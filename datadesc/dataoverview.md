There are two sets of research articles from the four journals. The first set is for the period ***1997 - 2006*** and the second set is for the period ***2007 - 2016***. 

# Types of Files

I have three basic types of files for use as sources of text inputs to form the basis of a corpus.
  1. xml: Bibliographic metadata in an xml file, one file per article. Relevant content in each file, includes authors, publication date, article title, journal title, and abstract. See example file.
  2. txt: A text file with the xml filename and the extracted abstract from that file, one journal/abstract combo per line. See example file.
  3. txt: A text file with extracted abstract only, one abstract per line. See example file.
