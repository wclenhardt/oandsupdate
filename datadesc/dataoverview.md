# Types of Files

I have three basic types of files for use as sources of text inputs to form the basis of a corpus.
  1. xml: Bibliographic metadata in an xml file, one file per article. Relevant content in each file, includes authors, publication date, article title, journal title, and abstract. See example file [journal-article-10.2307_30040732.xml](https://github.com/wclenhardt/oandsupdate/blob/master/datadesc/journal-article-10.2307_30040732.xml).  This file is for Aguilera and Jackson, "The Cross-National Diversity of Corporate Governance: Dimensions and Determinants" from *The Academy of Management Review* 28(3), July 2003. **N.B.: This file cannot be redistributed. It is JSTOR copyrighted material.**
  2. txt: A text file with the xml filename and the extracted abstract from that file, one journal/abstract combo per line. See example file...
  3. txt: A text file with extracted abstract only, one abstract per line. See example file  [Example with 3 abstracts](https://github.com/wclenhardt/oandsupdate/blob/master/datadesc/testextract.txt).
