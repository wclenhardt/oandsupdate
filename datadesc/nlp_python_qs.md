# Areas to Clarify Alternate Approaches
## Data Loading
 1. Is there a preference to load data as read a text file, or Bag of Words, or as a data frame?  Different NLP libraries generally seem to expect different raw inputs.
 2. 
 
## Preprocessing
 1. Still seeing some artifacts, like 1 or 2 letter words.
 2. Again, there are different approaches to preprocessing. The methods seemed tied to the data load method.  Is that correct?
 
## Desired Analyses
 1. Simple word counts on the corpus
 2. Similar 'simple' visualizations
 3. Approaches to making 'simple' comparisons between the two corpus, 1997 - 2006 decade and the 2007 - 2016 decade.
