            <p>In-depth interviews with business school faculty members suggest that work relationships are more than strategically chosen means to career mobility. Relationships are career-defining ends as well, and negative relationships may be as consequential as helpful ties. Findings also showed significant gender differences: women, more than men, told stories about harm; men, more than women, told stories about help. Workplace relationships may play different roles for professionals and managers, and men's and women's different relational experiences may foster different career logics, or ways of striving for success.</p>

            <p>This study examines the outcomes of technology-sourcing partnerships from the sourcing firms' point of view. Using a knowledge-based perspective, we develop a contingency model suggesting how the imitability, uniqueness, and uncertainty associated with a technology interact with partner interdependence to influence sourcing outcomes. Ninety-five sourcing arrangements spanning licensing, joint development, and acquisitions were examined close to the time of conception and three to four years afterward. Overall, the results support a contingency framework.</p>
            <p>We studied the reactions to an early retirement program of 668 employees of a large organization who were ineligible for the program. Specifically, we examined the influence of perceptions of the generosity of the organization's assistance to retirees (caretaking) on the remaining employees' intentions to quit. Findings contrasted with those from research on layoff survivors: perceptions of overly generous caretaking were associated with increased intentions to quit, particularly among more tenured employees.</p>
            <p>We focus on the beliefs that applicants develop about organizational culture during the anticipatory stage of socialization. Data from 240 job applicants suggested that an organization used product and company information to encourage applicants to hold favorable, rather than accurate, culture beliefs. For example, the organization appeared to overstate the degree to which its culture was risk-oriented. Information that is less susceptible to image management attempts (for instance, word of mouth) was unrelated to applicants' culture beliefs.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study was to assess the proposed moderating role of one individual-level health risk factor--hostility--in the relationship between job enrichment and health care costs for a sample of nurses. Our findings indicate that hostility does moderate the relationship between job enrichment and health care costs; however, those who have more control in their jobs have fewer health problems, even when they demonstrate more hostility.</p>
            <p>In a scenario-based study using Mexican and U.S. samples, when a team member was perceived to be an in-group (rather than an out-group) member, collectivists evaluated that member significantly more generously than did individualists. Further, collectivists valued maintenance contributions more than individualists did, and individualists valued task contributions more than collectivists did. Nevertheless, both collectivists and individualists appeared to value an equity norm.</p>

            <p>Although typically excluded from strategic human resource models, bundles of work-family policies may be an HR approach related to competitive advantage. Symbolic action and resource-based views provide conceptual support for such a relationship. Results from a national sample of 527 U.S. firms suggest that organizations with more extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance. In addition, there was partial support for the hypotheses that the relationship between work-family bundles and firm performance is stronger for older firms and firms employing larger proportions of women.</p>
            <p>This study uses the resource-based view of the firm and agency theory to examine the relationship between innovation and CEO pay in 90 high-technology firms. With firm size, performance, and other factors controlled, CEO short-term compensation was related to innovation as measured by number of patents and R&amp;D spending. The data also suggest a less consistent temporal relationship between innovation and long-term CEO compensation in the high-technology firms. In a control sample of 74 low-technology firms, there was no relationship between innovation and either short- or long-term CEO pay.</p>
            <p>Business schools strive to meet two goals: knowledge exploration through research and knowledge exploitation through instruction. Our results indicate that research performance (pages published in leading journals) and M.B.A. (master of business administration) program performance (popular business press rankings) are different. Research performance was improved by the number of faculty, the proportion of full professors, the proportion of assistant professors, and editorships. M.B.A. program performance was improved by the budget per faculty member and the proportion of full professors.</p>
            <p>Sixteen management fashions that emerged over the past five decades were identified and evaluated on eight criteria, including radicalness, broadness, and fear induction. We examined relationships among these criteria, fashions' life cycles, and economic and penetration variables to enhance understanding of fashions' emergence, diffusion, and decline. Results suggest that recent fashions were broader-based but shorter-lived and more difficult for upper management to implement. Hypotheses relating fashions to economic variables were only partially supported. Two potential explanations for the mixed results are offered.</p>

            <p>This article contributes to the theory of collaboration in social settings and is based on data collected during action research interventions in a number of public and community interorganizational collaborations. We conceptualize leadership in collaborations as stemming from three leadership media--structures, processes, and participants--and argue that none of these is wholly within the control of the members of a collaboration. Leadership activities that participants undertake in order to move a collaborative agenda forward are described.</p>
            <p>Employing a national sample of 1,162 employees, we examined the relationship between job and career attitudes and the presence of a mentor, the mentor's type (formal or informal), the quality of the mentoring relationship, and the perceived effectiveness and design of a formal mentoring program. Satisfaction with a mentoring relationship had a stronger impact on attitudes than the presence of a mentor, whether the relationship was formal or informal, or the design of a formal mentoring program.</p>
            <p>In this study, we used a continuity theory of aging to examine bridge employment. Excellent health, organizational tenure, and having working spouses and dependent children were positively associated with accepting bridge employment, and age and salary were inversely related to accepting such employment. Bridge employment was strongly related to both retirement satisfaction and overall life satisfaction. Volunteer work and leisure activity complemented bridge employment in facilitating adjustment to retirement.</p>
            <p>This study examines variation in organizational responses to part-time work arrangements among professionals and managers. Analyses of over 350 interviews generated three paradigms of differences in ways organizations implemented and interpreted reduced-load work: accommodation, elaboration, and transformation. The paradigms can be viewed as representing firms' proclivity to engage in organizational learning by using individual cases of reduced-load work as opportunities for learning new ways of working and new possibilities for core business priorities.</p>
            <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicts that the internationalization of businesses will accelerate in the 21st century. Our study examined how the risks of accelerated internationalization may be managed in 212 foreign market entries by 87 new ventures based in the United States. Findings suggested that ventures managed strategic international risks by exploiting simultaneous trade-offs among foreign revenue exposure, country risk, and entry mode commitment in each country.</p>

            <p>This study is a comparison of the strategies employed in management research in two periods, 1995-97 and 1985-87. Through a content analysis of articles from the "Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly", and the "Journal of Management", we examined the use of research methods for addressing issues of "triangulation" and validity, including internal, external, construct, and statistical conclusion validity. Results indicate some potentially important trends in reports of research strategies as well as decreases in the internal, external, and construct validity of studies.</p>
            <p> The construct of social embeddedness has helped explain some of the ways in which individuals and organizations form and sustain alliances. We introduce the construct of "ecological embeddedness," or the extent to which a manager is rooted in the land. Ecological embeddedness is illustrated by an ethnographic study of a Cree tallyman, or beaver trapper, in James Bay, northern Qu√©bec. To be ecologically embedded as a manager is to personally identify with the land, to adhere to beliefs of ecological respect, reciprocity, and caretaking, to actively gather ecological information, and to be physically located in the ecosystem. We conclude by drawing some implications for sustainability. </p>

            <p>Taylor's pig iron observations at Bethlehem Iron in 1899 are often cited as an example of how scientific management helped increase industrial efficiency. The current research, relying almost exclusively on primary sources, reveals that Taylor's famous pig iron anecdote was erroneous. Additionally, this article offers lessons and guidelines for managers in the new millennium.</p>
            <p>An increasing amount of high-quality research has been conducted in the past decade on the topic of managing organizations in the natural environment. We trace this evolution using path and challenge metaphors, indicating our belief that this research, including the nine articles in this special research forum, exhibits an increasing comprehensiveness and sophistication in the field. In addition, we set out our suggestions for continuing the evolution of both research and practice that address organizations managing for their own and nature's sustainability.</p>
            <p>Several bodies of literature contributed to a framework describing how three activities--identifying, packaging, and selling--can lead to successful environmental championing. The results of a field study comparing successful and unsuccessful championing episodes in U.S. business organizations supported the framework. Specifically, individuals who successfully championed environmental issues engaged in more environmental scanning, employed particular framing dimensions and presentation styles, and used several influence tactics. For some championing behaviors, successful outcomes depended on the strength of a company's environmental paradigm.</p>
            <p>Interview and questionnaire data obtained from 73 leaders of nonprofit environmentalist and for-profit environmental product and service organizations showed that these leaders' personal values were more ecocentric, open to change, and self-transcendent than those of managers in other types of organizations. These leaders also acted as "master managers," performing both transformational and transactional leadership behaviors. As hypothesized, nonprofit environmentalist organizations were highly receptive contexts for transformational leadership, whereas for-profit environmental organizations were at least moderately receptive in this regard. We used these findings to develop a preliminary model of environmental leadership.</p>

            <p>We assessed the relationships of environmental policy and supervisory support behaviors to employee environmental initiatives in leading-edge companies. We developed a behaviorally anchored rating scale instrument based on "learning organization" behaviors. In a survey conducted in European companies, employees used the scale we developed to assess their supervisors' daily behaviors. We analyzed the results using logit econometric analysis and other statistical tools to determine which environmental policy factors and management support behaviors positively related to employee "ecoinitiatives."</p>
            <p>We modified Ajzen's theory of planned behavior to analyze the behavioral preferences of environmental managers. We used structural equation analysis to link the source reduction preferences of 295 environmental managers to their pollution prevention attitudes, their perceptions of norms for environmental regulation, their perceived behavioral control, and the past source reduction activity of their facilities. The hypothesized model fit the data well, except that we found the perceived behavioral control variable was negatively rather than positively predictive of behavioral preferences for source reduction activity. Research and practical implications are suggested.</p>

            <p>
            <p>We investigated the individual and contextual influences shaping the environmental ethical decision intentions of a sample of managers in the U.S. metal-finishing industry in this study. Ajzen's (1991) theory of planned behavior and Jones's (1991) moral intensity construct grounded our theoretical framework. Findings revealed that the magnitude of consequences, a dimension of moral intensity, moderated the relationships between each of five antecedents--attitudes, subjective norms, and three perceived behavioral control factors (self-efficacy, financial cost, and ethical climate)--and managers' environmental ethical decision intentions. We then developed implications for theory and practice in environmental ethical decision making.</p>
            <p>Research on the effects on firm performance of "best practices" of environmental management, which are supposed to enable firms to simultaneously protect the environment and reduce costs, has so far ignored the roles of existing firm resources and capabilities. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, this study analyzes whether complementary assets are required to gain cost advantage from implementing best practices. Results based on survey data from 88 chemical companies indicate that capabilities for process innovation and implementation are complementary assets that moderate the relationship between best practices and cost advantage, a significant factor in determining firm performance.</p>
            <p>Drawing on the strategic issue interpretation literature, this study examined links between managerial interpretations of environmental issues and corporate choice of environmental strategy among 99 firms in the Canadian oil and gas industry. Environmental strategies ranging from conformance to regulations and standard industry practices on the one hand to voluntary actions for environmental preservation on the other were found to be associated with managerial interpretations of environmental issues as threats or as opportunities. Differences in managerial interpretations were influenced by certain factors in the organizational context, including the legitimation of environmental issues as an integral aspect of corporate identity and the discretionary slack available to managers for creative problem solving at the interface of the business and the natural environment.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>Industry self-regulation--the voluntary association of firms to control their collective action--has been proposed as a complement to government regulation. Proponents argue that the establishment of such structures may institutionalize environmental improvement, and critics suggest that without explicit sanctions, such structures will fall victim to opportunistic behavior. In a study of the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care Program, we investigate the predictions of these two contradictory perspectives. Our findings highlight the potential for opportunism to overcome the isomorphic pressures of even powerful self-regulatory institutions and suggest that effective industry self-regulation is difficult to maintain without explicit sanctions.</p>
            <p>We conducted a qualitative study of the motivations and contextual factors that induce corporate ecological responsiveness. Analytic induction applied to data collected from 53 firms in the United Kingdom and Japan revealed three motivations: competitiveness, legitimation, and ecological responsibility. These motivations were influenced by three contextual conditions: field cohesion, issue salience, and individual concern. In this article, we also identify the conditions that likely lead to high corporate ecological responsiveness.</p>
            <p>This research investigated whether procedural and interactional justice affect work-related outcomes through different social exchange relationships. The findings extend previous research by demonstrating that (1) interactional justice perceptions affect supervisor-related outcomes via the mediating variable of leader-member exchange and (2) procedural justice perceptions affect organization-related outcomes via the mediating variable of perceived organizational support.</p>
            <p>This study provides a partial test of our options-based model of career mobility in professional service firms (Malos &amp; Campion, 1995). After clustering a sample of 117 high-grossing U.S. law firms into two configurations suggested by strategic options analysis, we found internally consistent relationships among career mobility practices and career-related outcomes.</p>
            <p>Applying macro-level research on power and resource allocation to job evaluation in a university setting, we tested whether job evaluation outcomes were affected by departmental power. We found that departmental power had a positive effect on the number of a department's new positions and position upgrades that were authorized at the requested pay grade levels. Additionally, we considered power at the individual level of analysis and found that the effects of departmental power on new positions and position upgrades were greater when the position power of resource recipients was high.</p>
            <p>Drawing upon behavioral plasticity arguments, we posited that self-esteem is an important factor explaining the effects of two group characteristics, relationship conflict and task interdependence, on group members' performance and satisfaction. Results based on data from a sample of individuals working in classroom groups over a four-month period showed that when task interdependence was high, low self-esteem attenuated the negative relationship between relationship conflict and peer evaluations and exacerbated the positive relationship between relationship conflict and absenteeism.</p>
            <p> We used data from 45 production teams (626 individuals) and their supervisors to test hypotheses related to team structure. For teams engaged primarily in conceptual tasks, interdependence exhibited a ‚à™-shaped relationship with team performance, whereas team self-leadership exhibited a positive, linear relationship with performance. For teams engaged primarily in behavioral tasks, we found a ‚à©-shaped relationship between interdependence and performance and a negative, linear relationship between team self-leadership and performance. Intrateam process mediation was found for relationships with interdependence but not for relationships with team self-leadership. Overall, findings support a model of team structure and illustrate how relationships between structural characteristics and a team's performance can be moderated by its tasks. </p>

            <p>The incentive intensity of rewards (the individual marginal gains in pay triggered by increased performance) has been linked to higher effort and the attraction of talent. Determinants of incentive intensity for individual rewards have been widely examined, but determinants of incentive intensity for group rewards remain unexplored. We used agency theory to test such determinants in 663 group-based pay plans. Incentive intensity was higher when groups were small, when plans did not need to measure quality, and when management participation was high. Plans embedded in small firms and plans with longevity had higher incentive intensity.</p>
            <p>Although "valuing diversity" has become a watchword, field research on the impact of a culturally diverse workforce on organizational performance has not been forthcoming. Invoking a resource-based framework, in this study I examined the relationships among cultural (racial) diversity, business strategy, and firm performance in the banking industry. Racial diversity interacted with business strategy in determining firm performance measured in three different ways, as productivity, return on equity, and market performance. The results demonstrate that cultural diversity does in fact add value and, within the proper context, contributes to firm competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>Drawing on justice theory, I examined the consequences of abusive supervisor behavior. As expected, subordinates who perceived their supervisors were more abusive were more likely to quit their jobs. For subordinates who remained with their jobs, abusive supervision was associated with lower job and life satisfaction, lower normative and affective commitment, and higher continuance commitment, conflict between work and family, and psychological distress. Organizational justice mediated most of these effects, and job mobility moderated some of the deleterious effects of abusive supervision.</p>
            <p>Individual influence is thought to shape team performance. However, empirical studies of its potential determinants in multicultural teams, including national culture, are lacking. A network study of the management team of a 50-50 German-Japanese international joint venture revealed multiple significant determinants, with advice centrality the most closely associated with influence. National culture, though not statistically significant, remained important in explaining patterns of relationships in this team, but its role was far less direct and deterministic than suggested by prior research.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Investments in dispersed foreign subsidiaries and international joint ventures (IJVs) are often thought to enhance corporate flexibility and thereby reduce risk. We tested these predictions from real options theory and the international strategy literature using a set of recently developed downside risk measures. The evidence reveals that U.S. manufacturing firms with greater multinationality or investment in IJVs do not generally obtain lower levels of downside risk. Implications for theory and future empirical research are offered.</p>
            <p>In a survey of 2,200 individuals, we examined the degree to which work environments are structured to complement the creative requirements of jobs. Regression analyses indicated that proximal job characteristics were more strongly associated with a combined objective and perceptual measure of job-required creativity than were distal organizational characteristics. Furthermore, higher job satisfaction and lower intentions to leave were found for individuals whose work environments complemented the creative requirements of their jobs.</p>
            <p>We developed and tested hypotheses describing the psychological process invoked when managers receive requests for accommodations from employees with disabilities. In two scenario-based experiments, obligation and attitude had consistent effects on managers' intentions to comply, mediating the influence of performance instrumentality and perceived fairness. Psychological reactions were affected by the controllability of a disability's onset, the employee's past performance, and the size of the requested accommodation.</p>
            <p>In the prevalent rationalistic approaches, human competence at work is seen as constituted by a specific set of attributes, such as the knowledge and skills used in performing particular work. As an alternative to the rationalistic approaches, an interpretative approach, "phenomenography," is proposed and explored here. Findings suggest that the meaning work takes on for workers in their experience of it, rather than a specific set of attributes, constitutes competence. More specifically, the results demonstrate that the particular way of conceiving of work delimits certain attributes as essential and organizes them into a distinctive structure of competence at work.</p>
            <p>Focusing on hybrid team culture within transnational teams as a facilitator of group interaction, we hypothesized a curvilinear relationship between team heterogeneity on nationality and effective performance. Through a qualitative field study, we developed a mediation model of the effects of transnational team dynamics. Two confirmatory laboratory studies followed. The hypothesized curvilinear relationship was confirmed, with homogeneous and highly heterogeneous teams outperforming moderately heterogeneous ones in the long run. Drawing from conceptual work on status hierarchies, group "faultlines," and group membership, we discuss implications for team structures in transnational settings.</p>
            <p>Though key to fostering innovation, interpersonal exchanges of resources between R&amp;D scientists across organizational boundaries can represent intellectual capital leaks. A grounded theoretical framework is developed for individual exchange decisions. Social capital emerges as the key success factor in this resources acquisition process. Strategic resources can only be exchanged under conditions of acquaintance and mutual trust. The economic interests of a scientist's employing firm and personal considerations are intertwined.</p>
            <p>
            <p>The attitudinal and behavioral effects of being promoted and being rejected for promotion were examined in a quasi experiment conducted at an international bank in Hong Kong. Promoted tellers who had more internal locuses of control (LOC) maintained improved attitudes across 3- and 18-month posttest intervals. Attitudes returned to baseline levels by the second posttest among external-LOC individuals who had been promoted. There was no change in attitudes among people passed over for promotion. Absenteeism and job performance both decreased among promotees. The implications for the administration of promotions are considered.</p>
            <p>We used an experimental vignette to examine how two aspects of a decision explanation's packaging--its language and labeling of the decision process--affected perceptions of a decision maker's competency-based trustworthiness. These perceptions were higher when either easy-to-understand language or a legitimating decision process label was present than when both hard-to-understand language and no decision process label were present. These findings suggest that peripheral cues related to decision explanations' packaging may play an important role in improving perceptions of trustworthiness.</p>
            <p>We examined the role of the quality of reemployment in the process of coping with job loss using a panel design and a four-month interval for 100 displaced workers. The dynamic process of coping with job loss changed between the anticipatory and outcome stages. The quality of reemployment played a key role, interacting with time in such a way that satisfactorily reemployed workers experienced reduced economic discrepancies and replenished coping resources. The dissatisfactorily reemployed and the unemployed continued to experience negative effects.</p>
            <p>Downsizing disrupts existing social networks in organizations. Layoff survivors' reactions to losses of both friends and coworkers in similar structural positions (structural equivalents) are examined here. A field study conducted in a consumer electronics firm revealed negative reactions to the loss of friends and positive reactions to the loss of coworkers in similar structural positions. The loss of friends weakened survivors' network centrality, but the loss of structural equivalents benefited network position and increased satisfaction with promotion opportunities.</p>

            <p>Given differences in values about work and family time, we hypothesize that Americans will experience greater family demand, which will have greater impact on work-family conflict, whereas the Chinese will experience greater work demand, which will have the greater impact on work-family conflict. The results of a survey of working men and women in the two countries generally supported the hypotheses; however, work demand did not differ significantly between the two countries and did not have a greater effect than family demand on work-family conflict in China.</p>
            <p>Emerging economies are low-income, rapid-growth countries using economic liberalization as their primary engine of growth. They fall into two groups: developing countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East and transition economies in the former Soviet Union and China. Private and public enterprises have had to develop unique strategies to cope with the broad scope and rapidity of economic and political change in emerging economies. This Special Research Forum on Emerging Economies examines strategy formulation and implementation by private and public enterprises in several different regional settings and from three primary theoretical perspectives: institutional theory, transaction cost economics, and the resource-based view of the firm. In this introduction, we show how different theoretical perspectives can provide useful insights into enterprise strategies in emerging economies. We discuss the special methodological as well as empirical challenges associated with doing research in emerging economies. Finally, we briefly summarize the individual contributions of the works included in our special research forum.</p>
            <p>We demonstrate variation in the extent to which firms benefited from their affiliation with Chilean business groups in the 1988-96 period. The net benefits of unrelated diversification were positive if group diversification exceeded a threshold level, though this threshold increased with time. Sizable group benefits unrelated to diversification also existed, but they atrophied over time. We conjecture that the evolution of institutional context alters the value-creating potential of business groups, albeit slowly.</p>
            <p>Combining an agency perspective and downsizing research, in this study we examined two influences on employment-downsizing strategies in privatized firms in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine: corporate governance and institutional change initiated by business crisis, in turn attributable to industry and country factors. In line with theoretical predictions, the study shows that downsizing is strongly influenced by industry-specific factors, and it is positively associated with outside, noninstitutional shareholding. However, a firm's ability to downsize is negatively associated with the extent of managerial shareholding, a finding consistent with managerial entrenchment.</p>

            <p>This study jointly examines the effects of organizational capabilities and public and private expropriation hazards on the level of equity ownership chosen for foreign subsidiaries in emerging markets. Specifically, we explore the mechanisms by which 660 Japanese multinational corporations drew upon capabilities developed via industry-specific, country-specific, and total international experience to mitigate these hazards for their 2,827 subsidiaries in 18 emerging markets. Results strongly support a novel specification that forges a link between the capabilities and the public and private expropriation hazards literatures.</p>
            <p>
            <p>What factors influence a Chinese state-owned enterprise's choice among alternative strategies for acquiring complementary assets? In this study, I propose that the decision to make, buy, or ally to acquire new product technology is an outcome of a firm's simultaneous consideration of external competitive and internal capabilities-related factors. Hypotheses derived from transaction cost, resource dependency, and organizational capabilities perspectives were tested in a sample of Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical firms. Predicted and unexpected results provide insights into these firms' behavior and allow refinement of these theoretical perspectives in light of China's economic reforms and its particular organizational and institutional environment.</p>
            <p>
            <p>This study develops a framework for examining the export strategies of firms from emerging economies and their performance in foreign markets. Hypotheses derived from this framework were tested on a sample of firms from Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Findings suggest that cost-based strategies enhance export performance in developed country markets and differentiation strategies enhance performance in other developing countries. Adapting marketing mix variables to the specific needs of developed country markets also enhances export performance. The relationship between geographical diversification and export performance is nonlinear.</p>

            <p>Business groups in emerging economies result when entrepreneurs and firms accumulate the capability for repeated industry entry. Such a capability, however, can be maintained as a valuable, rare, and inimitable skill only as long as asymmetric foreign trade and investment conditions prevail. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data on a variety of emerging economies were used to test this hypothesis and three other competing explanations. The importance of business groups grew with foreign trade and investment asymmetries. The managerial problems and opportunities surrounding the rise and decline of business groups are discussed, especially in the context of the current turmoil in emerging economies.</p>

            <p>This study of entry into Central and Eastern Europe via acquisition of privatized firms combines a traditional merger approach with consideration of host governments as critical stakeholders and the country-specific risks of foreign direct investment in formerly Communist countries. We analyzed survey data on 170 privatization acquisitions by Western firms. The results provide insights into critical managerial issues for acquisitions in transitional economies, especially the importance attached to fit between the merging firms, and indicate a need to reexamine some previous privatization research.</p>
            <p>
            <p>We examined the effects of perceived strategic uncertainty in seven environmental sectors on the scanning behavior of Russian executives. Strategic uncertainty was highest in sectors influenced by transition and was moderated by perceptions of accessibility in determining scanning frequency, a relationship that held in predicting sources of information scanned. The perceived importance of environmental conditions was central to the relationships, suggesting that decomposition of the strategic uncertainty construct facilitates more insightful analysis of scanning behavior.</p>
            <p>This study examined the economic performance of the firms associated with Korean business groups by explicitly addressing groupwide resource sharing and internal business transactions. The results show that group-affiliated firms benefit from group membership through sharing intangible and financial resources with other member firms. Further, this study shows that various forms of internal business transactions, such as debt guarantee, equity investment, and internal trade, are extensively used for the purpose of cross-subsidization.</p>

            <p>This study of the international partner selection of firms from emerging (Mexico, Poland, and Romania) and developed (Canada, France, and the United States) markets supports resource-based and organizational learning explanations of such partner selection, a critical factor for success with international strategic alliances. Emerging market firms emphasized financial assets, technical capabilities, intangible assets, and willingness to share expertise in selection of partners more than developed market firms. In contrast, developed market firms tried to leverage their resources through partner selection. In particular, they emphasized unique competencies and local market knowledge and access in their partner selection more than emerging market firms.</p>
            <p>This study examined whether early movers and technology leaders attained superior performance in emerging economic regions. We assessed the determinants and performance consequences of two key aspects of entry strategy, resource commitment to technology transfer and timing of entry, using survey data from over 220 Sino-Japanese joint ventures (JVs) in China. Both high commitment and early entry has positive impacts on the perceived economic performance of the JVs. Yet these relationships were found to be significantly contingent on several internal and external factors, such as the strategic importance of an investment, parental control of a JV, and the availability of supporting local infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Using survey data from China, we demonstrate that managers' micro interpersonal ties with top executives at other firms and with government officials help improve macro organizational performance. This micro-macro link differs among firms with different (1) ownership types, (2) business sectors, (3) sizes, and (4) industry growth rates. In addition, managerial ties were found to be necessary but insufficient for good performance; a number of traditional strategy variables also drive performance. Theoretically, the findings point to the importance of the social context in which managerial ties are embedded. Empirically, this study provides the first set of quantitative data demonstrating both the extent and limits to which managerial ties are beneficial in a transition economy.</p>

            <p>To examine the effects of organizational strategic variables, such as management values regarding human resource management (HRM) and the sources of competitive advantage, we developed a model and tested it with data from 138 firms in Korea. The workers studied were nonmanagers. Firms with high scores on valuing HRM and people as a source of competitive advantage were more likely to have high-involvement HRM strategies. These variables also had positive effects on firm performance. In addition, firms with high-involvement HRM strategies had better performance.</p>
            <p>Countering arguments that employee benefits are unrelated to both worker performance and perceived organizational support, I developed and estimated a model that links work-life benefits to organizational citizenship behavior directly, through obligations incurred as a result of social exchange, and indirectly, through enhanced perceptions of organizational support. Significant, positive relationships were found between workers' assessments of the usefulness of work-life benefits and three measures of organizational citizenship. Although perceived benefit usefulness contributed to perceived organizational support, perceived organizational support did not in turn foster organizational citizenship as measured in this study.</p>
            <p>An organization's choice of a branch location can be analyzed as a market niche entry decision. This study builds theory on how an organization's decision makers evaluate market niches on the basis of competitive environment, learning from others, the organization's own experience, and proactive strategy, and it tests the theory with data on branch entry decisions of early Tokyo banks. Analysis of how decisions were affected by density dependence, mimetic isomorphism, decision-making momentum, and mutual forbearance shows strong evidence of influence from the local competitive environment, the actions of large organizations, and the organization's experience, and weaker evidence of proactive strategy.</p>
            <p>An archival study of the airline and trucking industries over a ten-year period and a laboratory study revealed that greater past success led to greater strategic persistence after a radical environmental change, and such persistence induced performance declines. The laboratory study also demonstrated that dysfunctional persistence is due to greater satisfaction with past performance, more confidence in the correctness of current strategies, higher goals and self-efficacy, and less seeking of information from critics.</p>
            <p>This article offers a cognitive account of the means versus ends focus of environmental regulation. The first of two studies suggests that standards (the means) exert an influence on judgments of proposed environmental solutions that is independent of the extent to which those solutions protect the environment (the ends). Standard-based decisions produce cognitive distortions, artificially enhancing the attractiveness of standard-conforming solutions over that of nonconforming solutions. Our second study suggests that "means" solutions tend to be preferred over "ends" solutions when one environmental proposal is examined. This pattern of preference can be reversed through the simultaneous evaluation of two proposals.</p>
            <p>We examined effects of a dissolved workplace romance and rater characteristics on judgments of responsibility and recommended personnel actions regarding a sexual harassment accusation. Type of romance and the romance motives of both accused and complainant were manipulated in vignettes describing a terminated liaison that resulted in a sexual harassment accusation. Results based on a sample of 226 sheriff's department employees indicate that judgments differed depending on romance motives, and recommended actions differed depending on romance type and rater characteristics. Implications for management research, theory, and practice are discussed.</p>
            <p>Current conceptualizations of procedural justice focus largely on the individual level of analysis; no framework exists for examining procedural justice's social context. Empirical tests reported here offer some support for group-level and cross-level hypotheses. Work group perceptions of cohesion and supervisor visibility in demonstrating procedural justice were associated with the development of procedural justice climate. Procedural justice climate was positively associated with helping behaviors after the effects of individual procedural justice perceptions were controlled for.</p>
            <p>Building upon the gender-based study conducted by Brett and Stroh (1997), we examined the moderating effects of gender and race on the relationship between changing employers and compensation attainment. The results suggest that, among graduates of M.B.A. (master of business administration) programs, the pay premium associated with an external labor market strategy is primarily a white-male phenomenon. White-male pay differentials were observed only among graduates who changed employers. These results challenge traditional labor-economic models of the compensation attainment process.</p>
            <p>Reflecting the internationalization of the marketplace and the increasing prominence of entrepreneurial firms in the global economy, the research paths of international business and entrepreneurship are intersecting with increasing frequency. International business researchers are broadening their traditional focus on large multinational companies to also include entrepreneurial firms in their research agendas. Cross-border business activity is of increasing interest to entrepreneurship researchers, and accelerated internationalization is being observed in even the smallest and newest organizations. This Special Research Forum on International Entrepreneurship reflects the fusion of these two areas and the developing worldwide academic interest in this topic.</p>
            <p>We employed knowledge-based theory to shed light on international growth in entrepreneurial firms. We found earlier initiation of internationalization and greater knowledge intensity to be associated with faster international growth. However, contrary to expectations, firms with more imitable technologies also grew faster. The former results suggest that early pursuit of international opportunity induces greater entrepreneurial behavior and confers a growth advantage, whereas the latter call into question current views of the role of imitability in international growth.</p>
            <p>An increasing number of new venture firms are internationalizing their business operations early in their life cycles. Previous explanations of this trend have focused on the importance of technological knowledge, skills, and resources for new ventures' international expansion. However, little is known about how these firms use the technological learning gained through internationalization. This study examined the effects of international expansion, as measured by international diversity and mode of market entry, on a firm's technological learning and the effects of this learning on the firm's financial performance.</p>

            <p>We consider the effect that national culture has on the propensity for small, independent manufacturing enterprises to (1) cooperate with other firms for technological innovation and (2) use equity ties in the formation of these alliances. Results from a five-country study indicate that national culture traits directly influence technology alliance formation and moderate the relationship between perceived technological uncertainty and alliance formation. Specifically, our results suggest that a resource dependence explanation for technology alliance formation is strongest for societies that maintain cooperative values and avoid uncertainty. A transaction cost explanation for the use of equity ties is strongest for societies that value individualism.</p>

            <p>Theories of social cognition, information processing, and expertise provided the foundation for a cross-cultural model of venture creation. Using data from seven countries, we found support for the cognitive model. In particular, arrangements, willingness, and ability scripts were found to be associated with the venture creation decision; some two-way interactions involving arrangements scripts were significant; and individualism and power distance were associated with willingness and ability scripts and with the venture creation decision, through interaction with arrangements scripts. Results support and extend theory and provide preliminary evidence of consistency in cognitive scripts across cultures.</p>

            <p>This study introduces and validates a measure of country institutional profile for entrepreneurship consisting of regulatory, cognitive, and normative dimensions. Sub-scales based on data from six countries show reliability, discriminant validity, and external validity. The instrument provides researchers with a valuable resource for exploring why entrepreneurs in one country may have a competitive advantage over entrepreneurs in other countries and how specific country-level institutional differences contribute differently to levels and types of entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p>This paper examines how emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence are associated with job performance. We develop and test a compensatory model that posits that the association between emotional intelligence and job performance becomes more positve as cognitive intelligence decreases. We report the results of a study in which employees completed tests of emotional intelligence and cognitive intelligence, and their task performance and organizational citizenship behavior were assessed by their supervisors. Hypotheses from the model were supported for task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, but not for organizational citizenship behavior directed at individuals. We discuss the theoretical implications and managerial ramifications of our model and findings.</p>

            <p>This paper examines contracting between a principal and an agent from the perspective of both social exchange theory and rational choice theory. Two experiments were conducted that tested competing predictions from the two theories. The first study examined effort decisions made by an agent under a series of contracts that varied in social context and compensation structure. The second experiment examined the negotiation of a compensation scheme between a principal and an agent and the agent's subsequent contract fulfillment, to test the mediating effects of verbal communication between parties on contracting and contract fulfillment. Both studies yielded results consistent with social exchange theory. Exchange theory appears to provide a better basis for deriving principles of organization design than rational choice.</p>
            <p>We develop a theory to explain how individual compassion in response to human pain in organizations becomes socially coordinated through a process we call compassion organizing. The theory specifies five mechanisms, including contextual enabling of attention, emotion, and trust, agents improvising structures, and symbolic enrichment, that show how the social architecture of an organization interacts with agency and emergent features to affect the extraction, generation, coordination, and calibration of resources. In doing so, our theory of compassion organizing suggests that the same structures designed for the normal work of organizations can be redirected to a new purpose to respond to members' pain. We discuss the implications of the theory for compassion organizing and for collective organizing more generally.</p>
            <p>Focusing empirically on what affected client defections from Arthur Andersen during its dramatic collapse in 2002, this study proposes that accountability-induced status anxiety is an important factor in the dissolution of interfirm relationships. Status anxiety--concerns about being devalued because other actors question the quality of a firm's partners--can motivate firms to disassociate themselves from their compromised high-status partners to protect their own status position. I hypothesize that accountability triggers status anxiety when firms are directly accountable to important audiences, when firms are surrounded by other firms that already have disassociated themselves from common partners, and when firms have committed themselves to a particular level of partner quality. Event-history analyses provide strong support for the accountability perspective on status anxiety: firms surrounded by stronger audiences, more defecting firms, and stronger commitments to audit quality were themselves more likely to defect.</p>

            <p>Using survey data on interpersonal influence behavior from a large sample of managers and chief executive officers (CEOs) at Forbes 500 companies, we examine how ingratiatory behavior directed at individuals who control access to board positions can provide an alternative pathway to the boardroom for managers who lack the social and educational credentials associated with the power elite. Findings show that top managers who engage in ingratiatory behavior toward their CEO, with ingratiation comprising flattery, opinion conformity, and favor-rendering, will be more likely to receive board appointments at other firms where their CEO serves as director and at boards to which the CEO is indirectly connected in the board interlock network. Further results suggest that interpersonal influence behavior substitutes to some degree for the advantages of an elite background or demographic majority status. Our findings help explain why norms of director deference to CEOs have persisted despite increased diversity in the corporate elite and have implications for research on corporate governance, social networks in the corporate elite, and for the sociological question of whether demographic minorities and individuals who lack privileged backgrounds have equal access to positions of leadership in large U.S. companies. Our study ultimately suggests that such individuals face a rather subtle and perhaps unexpected form of social discrimination, in that they must engage in a higher level of interpersonal influence behavior in order to have the same chance of obtaining a board appointment.</p>

            <p>We assess the factors affecting national administrative rationalization in the context of the current worldwide movement for governance reforms, focusing on national linkages to world society rather than internal socioeconomic development. We conduct cross-national longitudinal analyses of a multiple-indicator measure of rationalized governance for the period 1985-2002. Overall, there is only a very modest growth in the measure worldwide, with the most substantial changes occurring in developing countries. Change is mostly on an indicator of investment openness. National change tends to reflect links with global society: expanded trade, the penetration of science, and embeddedness in world organizations play prominent roles. The rationalization of national governance, like other dimensions of modernization, is not simply or principally a consequence of endogenous national development or social complexity. Rather, it directly reflects trade and institutional linkages with wider rationalizing movements in the context of a neoliberal world society.</p>
            <p>We develop a framework for defining the boundaries of within-population market segments, differentiated based on type and level of resources. Using this framework, we propose a theory of the moves between market segments of all firms in an organizational population across its evolution. Focusing on commensalistic interdependence within a segment, we adapt density dependence theory to predict that processes of mutualism and competition operate concurrently, even across high counts of density, and affect firms' propensity to desert their segment. Analyses of moves between market segments by firms in the U.S. auto industry between 1895 and 1981 confirm our predictions and suggest the operation of a basic ecological process that shapes the evolution of population structure.</p>

            <p>Based on comparative longitudinal case analyses of six new biotechnology firms, this paper explores how the configuration, management, and evolution of entrepreneurial firms' social capital affect firm performance. Findings suggest that firms can realize performance benefits when their members repeatedly adapt the configuration of their social capital to changing resource needs, while inertia turns a firm's social capital into a liability. Our research provides a dynamic view of the conditions and processes that produce such inertia, allow firms to overcome it, and develop a firm's social capital to organizational advantage. A core theoretical contribution of our study is to identify and theorize how the internal organization of firms' management of relationships with external partners, through horizontal and vertical differentiation and integration, affects the dynamic of firms' social capital, adaptive capacity, and performance.</p>
            <p>This essay initiates a stock taking conversation with the "Administrative Science Quarterly's broad community of scholars--its editors, editorial board members, reviewers, authors, submitters, and readers--about the criteria that organization studies scholars use in evaluating one another's work. I review "ASQ's" founding editors' vision for the field of organization studies, as articulated in essays by Edward Litchfield and James Thompson that appeared in the first issue of the journal in 1956. Then I outline seven concerns that have been voiced about the state of the field or "ASQ" in the subsequent 50 years, indicating how "ASQ's" content in recent years stacks up vis √† vis these concerns. Then I offer my own thoughts on these concerns. I argue that we should remain open to diverse modes of inquiry, but I also acknowledge significant challenges to doing so. I close with a list of questions to which readers might respond, in the hope of generating a dialog that can make "ASQ's" role in the social construction of the field of organizational studies more self-conscious and fruitful.</p>

            <p>This study uses data on the U.S. film industry from 1982 to 2001 to analyze the effects on box office performance of prior relationships between film producers and distributors. In contrast to prior studies, which have appeared to find performance benefits to both buyers and sellers when exchange occurs embedded within existing social relations, we propose that the apparent mutual advantages of embedded exchange can also emerge from endogenous behavior that benefits one party at the expense of the other: actors offer better terms of trade and allocate more resources to transactions embedded within existing social relations, thereby contributing to the ostensible advantages of such exchange patterns. Findings show that not only do distributors exhibit a preference for carrying films involving key personnel with whom they had prior exchange relations, but also they tend to favor these films when allocating scarce resources (opening dates and promotion effort). After controlling for the effects of these decisions, films with deeper prior relations to the distributor perform worse at the box office. The results suggest that, rather than benefiting from repeated exchange, distributors overallocate scarce resources to these prior exchange partners, enacting a self-confirming dynamic.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the leadership of extreme action teams-teams whose highly skilled members cooperate to perform urgent, unpredictable, interdependent, and highly consequential tasks while simultaneously coping with frequent changes in team composition and training their teams' novice members. Our qualitative investigation of the leadership of extreme action medical teams in an emergency trauma center revealed a hierarchical, deindividualized system of shared leadership. At the heart of this system is dynamic delegation: senior leaders' rapid and repeated delegation of the active leadership role to and withdrawal of the active leadership role from more junior leaders of the team. Our findings suggest that dynamic delegation enhances extreme action teams' ability to perform reliably while also building their novice team members' skills. We highlight the contigencies that guide senior leaders' delegation and withdrawal of the active leadership role, as well as the values and structures that motivate and enable the shared, ongoing practice of dynamic delegation. Further, we suggest that extreme action teams and other "improvisational" organizational units may achieve swift coordination and reliable performance by melding hierarchical and bureaucratic role-based structures with flexibility-enhancing processes. The insights emerging from our findings at once extend and challenge prior leadership theory and research, paving the way for further theory development and research on team leadership in dynamic settings.</p>
            <p>A case study of the Southwest Industrial Areas Foundation is used to examine how a mass-movement social organization has been able to avoid the consequences of an oligarchic leadership structure, which previous scholars have claimed leads inevitably to loss of membership commitment, "becalming," and goal displacement. The case describes this network of community organizations, which has a very strong and self-perpetuating authority structure but has nonetheless maintained the commitment and involvement of its membership for many decades as it addresses issues such as school reform, living wages, training programs, health insurance, and physical community infrastructure. The case shows how the organization maintained its membership commitment and a clear focus on its original objectives by enhancing the membership's sense of capacity and agency and building a culture of contestation within the organization that encourages the membership to push back against the elite who dominate the organization.</p>

            <p>We propose a model of group processes that accords a key role to the verification of people's self-views (thoughts and feelings about the self). This approach partially incorporates past work on self-categorization (under the rubric of verification of social self-views) and introduces a new set of processes (the verification of personal self-views) to the groups literature. Conceptual analysis and recent empirical evidence suggest the self-verification framework offers a novel perspective on finding value in diversity.</p>

This classification illustrates that the "free market" is but one possible type of economy and that other types are not best understood as imperfections. This classification helps to distinguish analytically among qualitatively different types of exchange arrangements and suggests bases from which to develop theories about the organization of markets and exchange systems of various types.</p>

We argue that a broker's social resources and dependence on the market, along with exogenous deal conditions, influence the broker's motivations and willingness to make tradeoffs between long-term and short-term considerations when constructing deal networks. We develop our model and propositions in the context of the U.S. initial public offerings market and then generalize these arguments to other market contexts.</p>

            <p>We argue that the greater the extent to which choice sets evolve as a consequence of firms' exploration activities, the less structured the firms' abandonment decisions become and, in turn, the less distinguishable a real option is from more generic notions of path dependence--a sequential stream of investment in and of itself does not constitute a real option. While organizational adaptations can extend the applicability of real options, they impose tradeoffs that may lead to the underutilization of discoveries made in the course of exploration.</p>

            <p>Four characterizations of options exist: (1) as a component of total firm value, (2) as specific projects, (3) as choices, and (4) as a heuristic for strategic investment. Option value exists when two conditions apply: future choices and potential for proprietary access to outcomes. Narrower boundary conditions are inconsistent with theory and incomplete for application. The option lens has promise for its power to shed economic insight into behavioral processes.</p>

            <p>As options models move from financial markets to corporate decision making, it is fitting to question the simple domain extension of option pricing theory by considering behavioral decision-making biases. We suggest, however, that, given the negative evolutionary consequences of ignoring optionlike investments, organizations invent heuristic rules to counter these biases. We propose the idea of a domain translation that shows how the basic insight of option pricing can be preserved through evolving complementary organizational rules.</p>

            <p>I examine the concern that unconstrained real options can lead to escalation of commitment and identify contexts in which escalation of commitment is likely. I argue that these situations fall primarily outside the realm of unregulated for-profit organizations and also that the predictions of agency and attribution theories counter the predictions of the escalation of commitment framework. Finally, I assert that optimality requires flexibility in the timing of the exercise of real options when returns on investment are volatile.</p>
            <p>The commentaries on our article fail to come to grips with the distinct challenges raised by a process of experimentation that leads to the discovery of new possible initiatives. These challenges differ from those posed by an investment that provides privileged access to a prespecified set of possible follow-on investments. By treating these challenges as simple problems of implementation, the commentaries ignore the strategic tradeoffs implied by efficient abandonment processes and, therefore, fail to clarify where the logic of real options is likely to be more (and less) helpful to strategy thinking.</p>

Propositions derived examine whether demographic dissimilarity will positively or negatively influence employee social identity.</p>

The strength of the HRM system can help explain how individual employee attributes accumulate to affect organizational effectiveness.</p>
            <p>Adopting the strategic leadership perspective, we develop a theoretical model of the impact of CEO and top manager leadership styles and practices on organizational learning.

We challenge this conventional wisdom by highlighting the value of transactional leadership as well.</p>

I also discuss what alliance managers can do to control the size of a project's gaps.</p>

An integrated framework for SHRM is presented, allowing an application of complexity principles at the appropriate level of abstraction in the HR system.</p>
            <p>Challengers can successfully compete against dominant firms in network markets through innovation. However, the type of innovation a challenger should compete with depends on characteristics of the market and technology. I develop a typology of product innovation to model expected returns from different types of innovation. This model indicates radical innovation can be more profitable than incremental innovation, incompatible innovation more profitable than compatible innovation, and radical-incompatible innovation more profitable--and less risky--than incremental-compatible innovation. Sometimes more risk is more prudent, given the market in play.</p>

            <p>We present six recommendations for building theories of work motivation that are more valid, more complete, broader in scope, and more useful to practitioners than existing theories. (1) Integrate extant theories by using existing meta-analyses to build a megatheory of work motivation. (2) Create a boundaryless science of work motivation. (3) Study the various types of relationships that could hold between general (trait) and situationally specific motivation. (4) Study subconscious as well as conscious motivation. (5) Use introspection explicitly in theory building. (6) Acknowledge the role of volition in human action when formulating theories.</p>
            <p>We examine the overlooked role of time in goal-setting theory and demonstrate how the integration of time into this theory adds to its dynamism and validity in the increasingly complex, constantly changing work environment. Following a brief discussion of developments in the scientific understanding of time, we discuss and illustrate how these new understandings enhance the utility and theoretical soundness of the theory and how time can be integrated into the theory's main components: goal difficulty, goal attainability, and goal specificity.</p>
            <p>Based on psychological and neurobiological theories of core affective experience, we identify a set of direct and indirect paths through which affective feelings at work affect three dimensions of behavioral outcomes: direction, intensity, and persistence. First, affective experience may influence these behavioral outcomes indirectly by affecting goal level and goal commitment, as well as three key judgment components of work motivation: expectancy judgments, utility judgments, and progress judgments. Second, affective experience may also affect these behavioral outcomes directly. We discuss implications of our model.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>We describe a framework for understanding how age-related changes in adult development affect work motivation, and, building on recent life-span theories and research on cognitive abilities, personality, affect, vocational interests, values, and self-concept, identify four intraindividual change trajectories (loss, gain, reorganization, and exchange). We discuss implications of the integrative framework for the use and effectiveness of different motivational strategies with midlife and older workers in a variety of jobs, as well as abiding issues and future research directions.</p>
            <p>We argue that additional understanding of work motivation can be gained by incorporating current insights concerning self-categorization and social identity processes and by examining the way in which these processes influence the motivation and behavior of individuals and groups at work. This theoretical perspective that focuses on the conditions determining different self-definitions allows us to show how individual and group processes interact to determine work motivation. To illustrate the added value of this approach, we develop some specific propositions concerning motivational processes underpinning leadership and group performance.</p>
            <p>The compensatory model of work motivation and volition synthesizes some previously unrelated lines of research. The structural components of the model are implicit motives, explicit motives, and perceived abilities; the functional processes are volitional regulation (compensating for inadequate motivation) and problem solving (compensating for inadequate perceived abilities). Propositions that integrate, challenge, and extend existing conceptions are derived. Moreover, the framework of the compensatory model suggests an agenda for future research.</p>

            <p>We highlight linguistic-related challenges in multicultural teams that increase the likelihood of emotional conflict, and also highlight the difficulty of "finding words" in emotional situations because of the nonlinear, fragmented, image-driven qualities of these circumstances. As a result, we question whether team members embroiled in emotional conflict ought to be advised to talk (discuss their feelings with the goal of repairing frayed relationships), whether this meaning of talk is shared by people from culturally different backgrounds, and what conflict management alternatives may exist when talk is not possible or desirable.</p>

            <p>Foreignness is generally viewed as a liability for the multinational enterprise, negatively affecting strategic fit and the successful transfer of firm assets abroad. Using semiotics--the study of how language systems convey meaning--and the Walt Disney Company's experiences in internationalization, I develop the notion of semantic fit as a necessary complement to strategic fit and formalize a conceptual model of recontextualization--the process by which firm assets take on new meanings in distinct cultural environments.</p>

            <p>We argue that the implications of the recursivity of language largely have been overlooked in the literature exploring the role of language in organizing. Exploiting a narrative interpretation of sensemaking in language, we illustrate how the metaconversation is constituted, showing how it simultaneously admits and reconstructs the local conversations of the organization into an encompassing conversation, where the identity of the organization as a whole is generated continually. The central process at work is the production of a metanarrative that enfolds and transcends the narratives of the communities composing an organization.</p>

            <p>We argue that the processes underlying institutionalization have not been investigated adequately and that discourse analysis provides a coherent framework for such investigation. Accordingly, we develop a discursive model of institutionalization that highlights the relationships among texts, discourse, institutions, and action. Based on this discursive model, we propose a set of conditions under which institutionalization processes are most likely to occur, and we conclude the article with an exploration of the model's implications for other areas of research.</p>

            <p>I use rhetorical theory to reconceptualize the diffusion of managerial practices. Specifically, I argue that the diffusion of a practice depends on the discursive justifications used to rationalize it. When such justifications are accepted and taken for granted, a practice reaches a state of institutionalization. Furthermore, I propose that changes in justifications and diffusion provide a basis for explaining institutionalization as both a process and a state. I then develop several propositions from this model.</p>
            <p>Research in industrial/organization economics and strategic management defines "competitive wars" as periods of intensified competitive activity, which tend to have negative performance consequences for the warring firms. Drawing on Wittgenstein's concept of "language games," we develop a model of competitive wars as a sociolinguistic process enacted through strategic actions, linguistic practices, and shifts in resource allocations. The model suggests that the war language game increases stakeholder involvement and enables the warring firms, oftentimes, to improve performance.</p>

            <p>Social science theories can become self-fulfilling by shaping institutional designs and management practices, as well as social norms and expectations about behavior, thereby creating the behavior they predict. They also perpetuate themselves by promulgating language and assumptions that become widely used and accepted. We illustrate these ideas by considering how the language and assumptions of economics shape management practices: theories can "win" in the marketplace for ideas, independent of their empirical validity, to the extent their assumptions and language become taken for granted and normatively valued, therefore creating conditions that make them come "true".</p>
            <p>
            <p>Ferraro, Pfeffer, and Sutton argue that the core basis for the dominance of economics lies in the institutionalization of the norms and language of economics. I argue that they externalize the blame for the failure of other social sciences, and I challenge the other social sciences to develop a research agenda that is capable of providing useful prescriptions to individuals, organizations, and society. I believe that internalizing the challenge, rather then externalizing the blame, is key to making the other social sciences more powerful.</p>
            <p>According to Bazerman, economics has achieved its position of dominance simply because it provides prescriptions whereas other social sciences do not. We challenge his argument by showing that other social sciences do offer prescriptive advice but are nonetheless rarely influential. We argue that the mechanisms through which economics and other social sciences gain influence and affect practice should be investigated more carefully by management scholars seeking to understand how to have greater impact on both public policy and management practice.</p>
            <p>Coordination is the process people use to create, adapt, and re-create organizations. We propose a theory of coordination as energy-in-conversation to help organizational scholars comprehend the emotional and motivational dynamics of coordination. Our model describes how people generate and diminish their energy in their attempts to coordinate, how this energy affects attempts to coordinate, and how coordinating affects the effort devoted to the activities in the process. This account of the coordination process presents a new approach for understanding performance in interdependent situations.</p>

            <p>We explore the relationship between discourse and interorganizational collaboration, arguing that interorganizational collaboration can be understood as the product of sets of conversations that draw on existing discourses. Specifically, we argue that effective collaboration, which we define as cooperative, interorganizational action that produces innovative, synergistic solutions and balances divergent stakeholder concerns, emerges out of a two-stage process. In this process conversations produce discursive resources that create a collective identity and translate it into effective collaboration.</p>
            <p>Invisible social identities influence social interaction in distinct ways and create unique dynamics in terms of identity management. We integrate research from the sexuality, illness, and racial diversity literature, as well as the stigma, disclosure, and identity literature, to create a generalized model of invisible identity management. We focus specifically on revealing and passing strategies of identity management and conclude by discussing the implications of invisible differences for diversity research.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical analysis of the follower's role in the charismatic leadership process. Specifically, we distinguish between two types of charismatic relationships--personalized and socialized--and present general propositions about how followers' self-concepts may determine the type of charismatic relationship they form with the leader. We then develop more specific propositions about the follower's role in various stages of the charismatic relationship process, and we conclude by outlining the implications of the propositions and suggesting further opportunities for theoretical extension.</p>
            <p>I adopt a dyadic perspective to examine the role of social influence on individuals' fulfillment evaluation of shared psychological contracts. I address two research questions on individuals' referent choice and use of referent information and introduce a theoretical framework for categorizing promises. This framework, consisting of the domain and contestability of promises, is used to address the two research questions and predict the effects of referent information on individuals' fulfillment evaluation of shared psychological contracts.</p>

Using the concept of improvisation, we reconcile two major time dichotomies associated with organizational phenomena: clock time versus event time and linear time versus cyclical time. We propose that improvisation offers a means for management theorists and practictioners to overcome these apparent time dichotomies.</p>

            <p>We examine how social capital dimensions of networks affect the transfer of knowledge between network members. We distinguish among three common network types: intracorporate networks, strategic alliances, and industrial districts. Using a social capital framework, we identify structural, cognitive, and relational dimensions for the three network types. We then link these social capital dimensions to the conditions that facilitate knowledge transfer. In doing so, we propose a set of conditions that promote knowledge transfer for the different network types.</p>

            <p>We critically examine the content of contemporary understandings of corporate citizenship and locate them within the extant body of research dealing with business-society relations. Our main purpose is to realize a theoretically informed definition of corporate citizenship that is descriptively robust and conceptually distinct from existing concepts in the literature. Specifically, our extended perspective exposes the element of "citizenship" and conceptualizes corporate citizenship as the administration of a bundle of individual citizenship rights--social, civil, and political--conventionally granted and protected by governments.</p>
            <p>We argue that power and politics provide the social energy that transforms the insights of individuals and groups into the institutions of an organization. Moreover, we propose that different forms of power in organizations are connected to specific learning processes--intuition is linked with discipline, interpretation with influence, integration with force, and institutionalization with domination--and that an examination of these different forms of power provides a basis for understanding why some insights become institutionalized while others do not.</p>

To capture this phenomenon, we introduce the construct of "necessary evils" and explore the inherent challenges such tasks pose for those who must perform them. Whereas previous research has established the importance of treating victims of necessary evils with interpersonal sensitivity, we focus on the challenges performers face when attempting to achieve this prescribed standard in practice.</p>

The model (1) focuses on the functions that coaching serves for a team, rather than on either specific leader behaviors or leadership styles, (2) identifies the specific times in the task performance process when coaching interventions are most likely to have their intended effects, and (3) explicates the conditions under which team-focused coaching is and is not likely to facilitate performance.</p>

            <p>Efforts to end sexual harassment that rely primarily on target reporting are unlikely to be successful because most targets do not report their experiences. Thus, we explore an alternative mechanism for controlling sexual harassment--observer intervention. We examine observer intervention in sexual harassment using the literature on bystander intervention for guidance. We describe the concept of observer intervention, develop a taxonomy of intervention types, and discuss factors promoting and inhibiting its occurrence.</p>

            <p>This special topic forum explores how governments matter in a number of ways: the extent to which government action can foster industry creation and economic development, the impact of corrupt governments on firm-level decision making by managers of multinational enterprises, the concept of the attractiveness of political markets and the impacts they can have on firm-level strategies, and how deregulation can affect the governance mechanisms of firms. Here we offer readers four views on research issues intended to complement the STF articles and to suggest other avenues for fruitful research.</p>

            <p>We articulate opportunities and challenges for governments and innovating firms operating within countries that display four types of national political institutional structures. We argue that corporatist and associational institutional structures influence governments' capabilities to support diffusion- and mission-oriented technology policies and firms' tendencies to engage in bricolage or breakthrough approaches to technological entrepreneurship. We then show how the relative strength of state institutions can amplify or compromise governments' policies and firms' innovation strategies.</p>
            <p>We consider the role of government in the process of technological development, showing that the role of government regarding technological development varies over the development process. When a country is far from the technological frontier, the government can spur economic development through the centralization of economic and political control, but as the economy approaches the technological frontier, government's role must change considerably, political and economic freedom being necessary. In addition, domestic business groups can act as substitutes for governmental intervention, and multinational corporations can supplement governmental efforts.</p>

            <p>We offer a simple model of policy making, emphasizing socialization and limits on human cognition to explicate mechanisms of change in emergent (as opposed to established) institutions. Emergent institutions are more susceptible to change, and their opponents may use frames or existing reference points to illustrate inconsistency with prevailing notions of legitimacy. Broader institutional structures and specific organizational characteristics moderate pressure for change. This perspective has novel implications for strategy and policy design.</p>

We introduce a two-dimensional framework to further the understanding of public sector corruption and identify its implications for MNEs. Using an institutional perspective, we examine how the pervasiveness and arbitrariness of corruption can affect an MNE's organizational legitimacy and strategic decision making. We apply our analysis to the mode of entry decision.</p>

            <p>We conceptualize democracies as marketlike processes where demanders and suppliers of various public policies interact. Firms may enter political markets to seek new or to maintain existing policies that affect their current business operations or future opportunities. We contend that a firm's decision to become politically active is influenced, in part, by the attractiveness of the political market, and we outline conditions that make political markets more or less attractive for firms to compete in to advance their interests.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Government regulation in an industry is an intermediary in the principal-agent relationship that acts as a substitute for internal governance mechanisms. We propose a model for studying how different forms of deregulation (frame-breaking, metamorphic, piecemeal, and plodding) impact variations in the speed of adaptation of internal governance mechanisms to the theoretical predictions of agency theory and resulting performance implications. We develop illustrative propositions for a set of contigencies that moderate the above relationship. How government and firms manage the deregulatory process has important economic and social consequences.</p>

            <p>Executive jobs vary widely in the difficulty they pose for their incumbents, yet research on top executives and strategic decision making has largely ignored this reality. We build on work in industrial/organizational psychology to develop the construct of executive job demands; discuss its major determinants; propose some of its key implications for strategic choices and leadership behaviors; and propose the usefulness of this construct in advancing research on numerous fronts, including agency theory, executive compensation, and upper echelons.</p>
            <p>Hambrick, Finkelstein, and Mooney advance propositions concerning the effects of job demands on executive leadership and decision-making behaviors. I aim to encourage further thinking in this area, with comments flowing from a consideration of the stress and decision-making literature and the positive affect and problem-solving behavior literature. This perspective suggests both a finer-grained conceptualization of the executive job demands construct informed by specific characteristics of decision problems and a finer-grained conceptualization of executive decision behaviors focused on elements reflecting correspondence and coherence outcomes of decisions.</p>
            <p>In our conceptualization of executive job demands, we sought to integrate a diverse body of literature from strategy, organization theory, and organizational behavior. Ganster suggests that such an integration of ideas is highly welcome but also incomplete. We build on several of Ganster's key points to further clarify the executive job demands construct, and we expand the range of possible research questions that come out of a more complete integration of ideas from the macro and micro spheres of organizational science.</p>
            <p>Current models of how emotion regulation impacts strain focus on intraindividual processes that operate within the mind and body of the person regulating the emotion. This article presents a social interaction model of how emotion regulation impacts strain based on interpersonal processes. In this model, explanations of how emotion regulation impacts strain are based on the receiver's response to the sender's emotion regulation and display, the form of emotion regulation, and the emotion being regulated.</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical model that attempts to generalize the conditions for alliance formation. This model is based on internal and external conditions of alliance formation: resource heterogeneity and competitive dynamics. We also introduce a game-theoretic model of alliance formation according to the net gains from an alliance and the prevention of losses that could occur from competitors' alliance activities. The model provides a theoretical insight on a paradoxical setting that some firms join an alliance despite little gains while others avoid or delay it despite potentially strong gains from the alliance.</p>

            <p>Firms use political strategies when attempting to influence public policy decisions. One common assumption is that firms' political strategies will be less effective if the public policy issue has widespread interest among a large segment of likely voters--a "widely salient" issue. We explore how information and reputation cascades, driven by activists or nongovernmental organizations, cause public policy issues to become widely salient. We then discuss how firms can prevent the occurrence of such widespread salience and how they can respond once an issue has become widely salient.</p>

            <p>Territorial feelings and behaviors are important, pervasive, and yet largely overlooked aspects of organizational life. Organizational members can and do become territorial over physical spaces, ideas, roles, relationships, and other potential possessions in organizations. We examine how territorial behaviors are used to construct, communicate, maintain, and restore territories in organizations. We then go on to discuss the organizational consequences of these behaviors, including their effects on organizational commitment, conflict, preoccupation, and individual isolation.</p>
            <p>We propose a model of justice in teams that articulates the social influence processes through which shared perceptions of justice emerge and that explores the subsequent effects on team effectiveness outcomes. We also consider barriers to the emergence of shared team justice and introduce configural forms of justice that may result. Theoretical and practical contributions of the model for understanding the meaning and operation of justice at the team level of analysis are discussed.</p>
            <p>I argue that attempts to adapt structure to contingencies will be unsuccessful unless there is also rhetorical congruence, which has two parts. First, rhetorical congruence exists if rhetoric is appropriate to contingencies. For example, decentralization aimed at increasing local initiative will lead to more requests by headquarters for advice from subsidiaries. Second, it exists if the various rhetorical processes are in balance with one another. For example, as the environment becomes more uncertain and as more differentiation rhetoric is used in response, further integration rhetoric will be prompted to reestablish balance.</p>
            <p>"What determines the scope of the firm?" is one of the most fundamental questions in strategic management. We argue that, in addition to product relatedness, a focus on institutional relatedness--defined as an organization's informal linkages with dominant institutions that confer resources and legitimacy--helps answer this question. We address this question both longitudinally (firms in developed and emerging economies over time) and cross-sectionally (developed versus emerging economies), thus contributing to an institution-based theory of corporate diversification.</p>

            <p>We present a theory of how individuals compose their reflected best-self portrait, which we define as a changing self-knowledge structure about who one is at one's best. We posit that people compose their reflected best-self portrait through social experiences that draw on intrapsychic and interpersonal resources. By weaving together microlevel theories of personal change and macrolevel theories of human resource development, our theory reveals an important means by which work organizations affect people's capacity to realize their potential.</p>

            <p>I attempt to explain why employees prefer different forms of social exchange by proposing that such preferences align with their identity orientations. I also develop a model outlining how identity orientations play an important role in developing employee exchange relations and how they may help predict the consequences of exchange dynamics. By identifying linkages between identity orientations and forms of social exchange, I hope to stimulate future research on the connections between social exchange theory and the identity orientation framework.</p>

            <p>Despite the increased salience of metaphor in organization theory, current perspectives are flawed and misguided in assuming that metaphor can be explained with the so-called comparison model. I therefore outline an alternative model of metaphor understanding--the domains-interaction model--which suggests that metaphor involves the conjunction of whole semantic domains in which a correspondence between terms or concepts is constructed rather than deciphered and where the resulting image and meaning is creative. I also discuss implications of this model for organizational theorizing and research.</p>
            <p>Previous research on ingratiation in organizations has identified various categories of ingratiatory behaviors. However, these studies have failed to mention or investigate the ingratiatory power of humor. I integrate past research on ingratiation with research on humor in organizations to propose humor as a type of ingratiatory behavior in the workplace. I describe how humor affects targets, including determinants of humor's effectiveness as an ingratiation strategy, and various outcomes of humor as an ingratiation tactic.</p>

            <p>I present a complex theoretical explanation that draws on multiple bodies of literature to present an academically rigorous version of a simple argument: good deeds earn chits. I advance/defend three core assertions: (1) corporate philanthropy can generate positive moral capital among communities and stakeholders, (2) moral capital can provide shareholders with insurance-like protection for a firm's relationship-based intangible assets, and (3) this protection contributes to shareholder wealth. I highlight several managerial implications of these core assertions.</p>

            <p>Power is widely acknowledged to affect negotiator performance. Yet few efforts have been made to integrate the most prominent theories of power into a cohesive frame-work that can account for the results from a broad array of negotiation-relevant research. We address this limitation by proposing a dynamic integrative model that decouples power into four components: (1) potential power, (2) perceived power, (3) power tactics, and (4) realized power. Implications, propositions, and future directions are discussed.</p>

            <p>Creating competitive industries has become one of the key tasks of governments. Different adaptation outcomes in industries across nations cannot be accounted for fully simply by an emphasis on firm-level capabilities, market-driven policies, or state-level policies. We propose an integrative framework that draws on both the strategic management and political economy literature to explain variations in national industrial competitiveness. We discuss differences with respect to institutional characteristics and capabilities, competitive outcomes, conditions of best fit, and who bears the cost of industry adaptation.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical framework of involuntary executive turnover by paying close attention to the environmental and organizational contexts executives face. We classify these contexts into four scenarios based on high and low levels of latitude of objectives and latitude of actions. Our framework posits that latitude of objectives and latitude of actions interact to affect the causes and performance consequences of involuntary executive turnover, as well as which executives will be forced to depart.</p>
            <p>A series of financial scandals revealed a key weakness in the American business model: the failure of the U.S. auditing system to deliver true independence. We offer a two-tiered analysis of what went wrong. At the more micro tier, we advance moral seduction theory, explaining why professionals are often unaware of how morally compromised they have become by conflicts of interest. At the more macro tier, we offer issue-cycle theory, explaining why conflicts of interest of the sort that compromise major accounting firms are so pervasive.</p>

            <p>Moore, Tetlock, Tanlu, and Bazerman conclude that recent auditing reforms are misguided and insufficient. I argue that Moore et al. do not consider sufficiently how recent reforms reduce the likelihood of audit failure by affecting the incentives and actions of audit clients as well as auditors. I conclude that further research is necessary to understand the effects (both intended and unintended) of recent reforms before enacting further reforms.</p>

We argue that the risk of doing nothing is greater than the risk associated with reform, and that the arguments Nelson makes have been exploited by the auditing industry to defend a system that destroys the independence of audits for the financial benefit of the auditors themselves.</p>
            <p>We extend the concept of celebrity from the individual to the firm level of analysis and argue that the high level of public attention and the positive emotional responses that define celebrity increase the economic opportunities available to a firm. We develop a theoretical framework explaining how the media construct firm celebrity by creating a "dramatized reality" in reporting on industry change and firms' actions. Firms contribute to this process by taking nonconforming actions and proactively seeking to manage impressions about themselves.</p>

In this article we propose a theoretical model of work-family enrichment and offer a series of research propositions that reflect two paths to enrichment: an instrumental path and an affective path. We then examine the implications of the model for future research on the work-family enrichment process.</p>
            <p>Our objective is to discuss, in the organizational change literature, the recurring use of what we call the "sameness principle," along with another principle, inspired by contemporary philosophy and somehow present in the organizational ethics literature, called "otherness." We review four classic organizational change approaches, underscore the limitations of the sameness principle, and position otherness relative to current organizational ethics literature. We then emphasize the role of powerful agents within the organization as potential conveyors of otherness and deduce propositions that relate these agents' posture to the observable type of organizational change processes.</p>

            <p>By working with and through the paradoxes present in the resource-based view (RBV) of strategic management, scholars can advance understanding concerning the contradictions and tensions inherent in creating and sustaining superior firm performance. We identify and discuss various RBV paradoxes, illustrating how paradoxical thinking can enhance theorizing and open up new vistas for knowing and understanding. Finally, we discuss the utility of the paradoxical perspective in furthering RBV scholarship.</p>

            <p>By considering the amount of uncertainty perceived and the willingness to bear uncertainty concomitantly, we provide a more complete conceptual model of entrepreneurial action that allows for examination of entrepreneurial action at the individual level of analysis while remaining consistent with a rich legacy of system-level theories of the entrepreneur. Our model not only exposes limitations of existing theories of entrepreneurial action but also contributes to a deeper understanding of important conceptual issues, such as the nature of opportunity and the potential for philosophical reconciliation among entrepreneurship scholars.</p>

            <p>I present a model of capability reconfiguration, integrating the Schumpeterian perspective on technological discontinuities with the dynamic capabilities literature to explain the responses of incumbents to technological change. I identify substitution, evolution, and transformation as three mechanisms of capability reconfiguration and then link the choice of reconfiguration mechanism to the nature of technological change and to the attributes of capabilities. I conclude that the extent to which the chosen mechanism enables incumbents to overcome cognitive and operational impediments influences their capacity to bridge capability gaps.</p>

We then develop the linkage between causal ambiguity and management perception.

Specifically, we show how particular controls (outcome, process, and clan) differ in their ability to acquire, transfer, interpret, and, finally, use knowledge. We argue that the use of different controls therefore creates distinguishably different knowledge management processes within the firm.</p>

            <p>I explore the promise organization research offers for improved management practice and how, at present, it falls short. Using evidence-based medicine as an exemplar, I identify ways of closing the prevailing "research-practice gap"--the failure of organizations and managers to base practices on best available evidence. I close with guidance for researchers, educators, and managers for translating the principles governing human behavior and organizational processes into more effective management practice.</p>
            <p>In this article I examine the attractions and shortcomings of the "positive" neohumanistic turn in organizational theorizing and how positivity might be developed. I evaluate positivity's moral and cultural underpinnings and claims to separate positive from negative emotions, and I explore the deployment of positiveness in HRM programs of empowerment, emotional intelligence, and fun at work. I conclude with suggestions on how positive scholarship could be reconfigured in light of the present critique and against the emancipatory ideas of critical organizational theory.</p>

            <p>Fineman raises concerns regarding the implications of positive scholarship for organizational theory and managerial practice. I suggest that illuminating positive states, dynamics, and outcomes enriches theoretical perspectives and invites new directions for empirical research. Gaining a deep understanding of generative mechanisms may ultimately enhance the quality of life for individuals who work within and are affected by work organizations.</p>
            <p>In my critique of positiveness I raised a number of key concerns about the conceptualization and development of the positive perspective in organizational behavior and organizational studies. Roberts addresses some of my worries, but still leaves open some importance questions, in particular the ontological assumptions that underpin positiveness and the scope for embracing critical theory.</p>
            <p>In this article we develop the concept of community-based enterprise (CBE) and argue that it provides a potential strategy for sustainable local development in poor populations. We maintain that in this emerging form of entrepreneurship, typically rooted in community culture, natural and social capital are integral and inseparable from economic considerations, transforming the community into an entrepreneur and an enterprise. Drawing on interdisciplinary and multilevel approaches, we propose a theoretical model of the determinants, characteristics, and consequences of CBEs.</p>
            <p>
            <p>We argue that citizenship programs are strategic investments comparable to R&amp;D and advertising. They can create intangible assets that help companies overcome nationalistic barriers, facilitate globalization, and outcompete local rivals. Program content selection reflects a balance between legitimation and differentiation, and choices are influenced both by local institutional environments that shape expectations of corporate commitment to citizenship and by the degree of customization required because of institutional distance. Citizenship profiles therefore enable the sociocognitive integration that global companies require to operate effectively across diverse local markets.</p>

            <p>We integrate the predictions of prospect theory, the threat-rigidity hypothesis, and institutional theory to suggest how patterns of institutional persistence and change depend on whether decision makers view environmental shifts as potential opportunities for or threats to gaining legitimacy. We argue that in the event that decision makers face ambiguity in their reading of the environment, they initiate decoupled substantive and symbolic actions that simultaneously accommodate the predictions of prospect theory and the threat-rigidity hypothesis.</p>

            <p>Scholars from diverse disciplines have proposed numerous theories of business imitation. We organize these theories into two broad categories: (1) information-based theories, where firms follow others that are perceived as having superior information, and (2) rivalry-based theories, where firms imitate others to maintain competitive parity or limit rivalry. We describe conditions under which each type of imitation is most likely and offer guidance on identifying imitation in practice. Amplification effects and other performance implications of imitation are also addressed.</p>

I define context as situational opportunities and constraints that affect the occurrence and meaning of organizational behavior as well as functional relationships between variables, and I propose two levels of analysis for thinking about context--one grounded in journalistic practice and the other in classic social psychology. Several means of contextualizing research are considered.</p>
            <p>We argue that combining the insights from both the industrial organization and organizational ecology perspectives is likely to produce value added. We develop a resource-based theory of market structure, where resources pertain to the environmental assets (together forming the resource space) without which a firm cannot operate viably. We propose that the distributive shape of the resource space, together with the presence or absence of exploitation economies, molds market structures in terms of density and concentration. Our theory unifies many unconnected strands of theory in the organization sciences domain.</p>

We delineate the conditions through which relational self-construals (RSC) become accessible in negotiations and the conditions that inhibit their use, and we illustrate mechanisms through which RSC affects negotiation processes and outcomes. We introduce four relational dynamics--arelational trading, relational satisficing, relational distancing, and relational integrating--and discuss their consequences for the accumulation of economic and relational capital in negotiation.</p>
            <p>Tacit knowledge, one of the most promising resources, is among the toughest to leverage. It is important because it is often inimitable. However, increasing its scale may require codification, which may make it imitable. We explore and illustrate an approach to applying information technologies to leverage scarce expertise without codifying or transferring knowledge. Such technology may allow individuals to further specialize and generate more tacit knowledge, preserving the strategic properties of knowledge while scaling up.</p>

            <p>We argue that the risk associated with the value of a firm's core resources has an impact on employee decisions to make firm-specific investments, independent of the threat of opportunism that might exist in a particular exchange. We further explore mechanisms firms may adopt to mitigate the employee incentive problem stemming from the risk associated with core resource value. These arguments shed new light on resource-based theories of corporate diversification.</p>

            <p>Integrative social contracts theory is arguably the most promising theory of business ethics to date, but often criticized for its inability to produce substantive, action-guiding norms. Rather than importing moral substance from outside the contractualist framework, or abandoning contractualist business ethics (CBE) altogether, we seek to advance CBE by exploring the internal morality of contracting. We demonstrate that substantive norms for guiding and constraining business conduct can be produced without relying on premises from outside the contractualist framework.</p>

Each paper breaks new ground; collectively, they suggest that we are at a crossroads in network research. Important opportunities remain, however, for further work in network theory development, and we highlight major gaps relating to network theory's scope and mission, accessibility, integration with other perspectives, and attention to process and internationalization issues.</p>
            <p>We introduce the concept of group social capital--the set of resources made available to a group through members' social relationships within the social structure of the group and in the broader formal and informal structure of the organization. We argue that greater group social capital resources lead to greater group effectiveness and that there are many different conduits through which group social capital resources flow. We present a multilevel, multidimensional model arguing that an optimal balance of all these conduits maximizes group social capital resources and group effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Drawing on embedded intergroup relations theory and social identity theory, I propose a multilevel model of external team networking. In light of the growing diversity of the U.S. workplace, the propositions outlined in this paper examine the joint effects of organizational demography and team composition on specific sociometric properties of a team's external networks. The proposed model provides the basis for identifying team networking strategies in multiple organizational contexts.</p>

Whereas network researchers have emphasized the benefits and opportunities derived from positive interpersonal relationships, we examine the social liabilities that can result from negative relationships in order to flesh out the entire "social ledger." Deriving our argument from theory and research on negative asymmetry, we propose that these negative relationships may have greater power than positive relationships to explain workplace outcomes.</p>

            <p>The theory of network generation I present predicts actor selection and retention in forming an advice network. The research question explored is whom do people contact when needing advice? The theory posits that the advice seeker, when possessing rich information on potential alters, decides whom to contact by trading off expected knowledge value versus the cost of obtaining it. In the contact information poor case, alter selection antecedents are the potential contact's accessibility and perceived willingness to share advice.</p>
            <p>I extend the resource-based view to incorporate the network resources of interconnected firms. My model distinguishes shared resources from nonshared resources; identifies new types of rent; and illustrates how firm-, relation-, and partner-specific factors determine the contribution of network resources to the rents extracted from alliance networks. After reassessing the heterogeneity, imperfect mobility, imitability, and substitutability conditions, I conclude that the nature of relationships may matter more than the nature of resources in networked environments.</p>

            <p>Innovation networks can often be viewed as loosely coupled systems of autonomous firms. We propose that hub firms orchestrate network activities to ensure the creation and extraction of value, without the benefit of hierarchical authority. Orchestration comprises knowledge mobility, innovation appropriability, and network stability. We reject the view of network members as inert entities that merely respond to inducements and constraints arising from their network ties, and we embrace the essential player-structure duality present in networks.</p>

            <p>This paper suggests a cross-level understanding of the embeddedness of interfirm partnering in the context of the formation of new partnerships. It makes a critical distinction among environmental embeddedness, interorganizational embeddedness, and dyadic embeddedness, stressing the importance of understanding the interaction of these different levels of embeddedness. This focus on the complex interaction effects of different levels of embeddedness of interfirm partnering sets this contribution apart from previous work in the field.</p>

            <p>Network forms of organization, unlike hierarchies or marketplaces, are agile and are constantly adapting as new links are added and dysfunctional ones dropped. We review some of the theoretical and methodological accomplishments and challenges of contemporary research on organizational networks. We then offer an analytic framework that can be used to specify and statistically test simultaneously multilevel, multitheoretical hypotheses about the structural tendencies of organizational networks. We conclude with an empirical study illustrating some of the capabilities of this framework.</p>

            <p>We introduce the construct of network inertia, referring to a persistent organizational resistance to changing interorganizational network ties or difficulties that an organization faces when it attempts to dissolve old relationships and form new network ties. Previous research has neglected the process of network change in favor of an emphasis on identifying beneficial content effects of networks. We emphasize the constraints on network change and propose a multilevel conceptual model relating key sources of network inertia to changes in network ties. We also discuss the implications of network inertia for the evolution of networks.</p>
            <p>
            <p>We develop a framework examining the relationship between environmental change and patterns of network change. We propose four patterns of network change (network expansion, network churning, network strengthening, and network shrinking) across four environmental change scenarios. Since network evolution is the result of both environmental context and strategic action, we incorporate strategic orientation as a moderator. Focusing on network change at both the firm and network levels of analysis will guide us toward a better understanding of the principles behind the building of effective networks.</p>
            <p>Drawing on transaction cost economics and externalities theory, we argue that private-public partnerships will be necessary when economic opportunity realization (1) calls for industry-specific competencies but entails significant positive externalities (i.e., implies specialized private actions with significant public benefits), (2) is shrouded by high uncertainty for the private actors, and (3) necessitates for private actors high governance costs for contracting, coordinating, and enforcing. Thus, specialized resources, positive externalities, uncertainty, and governance costs are all jointly implicated in our theory.</p>

            <p>We examine three related ways in which the gap between theory and practice has been framed. One approach views it as a knowledge transfer problem, a second argues that theory and practice represent distinct kinds of knowledge, and a third incorporates a strategy of arbitrage--leading to the view that the gap is a knowledge production problem. We propose a method of engaged scholarship for addressing the knowledge production problem, arguing that engaged scholarship not only enhances the relevance of research for practice but also contributes significantly to advancing research knowledge in a given domain.</p>

            <p>Practitioners find little value in academic research. Some see it as a knowledge flow problem; others see practitioner and academic knowledge as unrelated. Van de Ven and Johnson propose a pluralistic collective of researchers and practitioners using "engaged scholarship" and intellectual arbitrage to create practitioner-meaningful research. It's a nice dream, but not a solution; bias, disciplines, and particularism remain. Neither discipline-centric nor practitioner-driven research offers a solution. Earthquake science offers a better model for business school research.</p>
            <p>Bill McKelvey's commentary is provocative, but four points need correction. (1) The purpose of engaged scholarship is not just to advance practice but to create scientific knowledge. (2) Bill's food chain metaphor mistakenly views the gap between science and practice as a knowledge transfer problem. (3) Bill ignores the impact of biases of researchers by only focusing on practitioner bias. (4) He considers differing views of researchers and practitioners as antithetical; we view them as complementary.</p>
            <p>We conduct a detailed analysis of 289 absorptive capacity papers from 14 journals to assess how the construct has been utilized, examine the key papers in the field, and identify the substantive contributions to the broader literature using a thematic analysis. We argue that research in this area is fundamentally driven by five critical assumptions that we conclude have led to its reification and that this reification has led to stifling of research in this area. To address this, we propose a model of absorptive capacity processes, antecedents, and outcomes.</p>

            <p>We introduce a collective action model of institutional innovation. This model, based on converging perspectives from the technology innovation management and social movements literature, views institutional change as a dialectical process in which partisan actors espousing conflicting views confront each other and engage in political behaviors to create and change institutions. The model represents an important complement to existing models of institutional change. We discuss how these models together account for various stages and cycles of institutional change.</p>
            <p>Progress toward understanding human behavior has been hindered by discipline-bound theories, dividing our efforts. Fortunately, these separate endeavors are converging and can be effectively integrated. Focusing on the fundamental features of picoeconomics, expectancy theory, cumulative prospect theory, and need theory, we construct a temporal motivational theory (TMT). TMT appears consistent with the major findings from many other investigations, including psychobiology and behaviorism. The potential implications of TMT are numerous, affecting our understanding on a wide range of topics, including group behavior, job design, stock market behavior, and goal setting.</p>

            <p>Recent critiques of internationalization process models question the wisdom of delaying internationalization. Internationalizing late allows firms to assemble resources and gain experience but also allows inertia to develop. We resolve this tension by positing that internationalization has differing effects on firm survival and growth. These effects are moderated by organizational age, managerial experience, and resource fungibility. Our framework provides insights into the evolution of capabilities across borders and may be tested and built on by organization researchers.</p>

            <p>We identify two "discursive formations" of organizational surveillance (two coherent but competing systems of representation) that figure prominently in organization and management studies: the "coercive" formation and the "caring" formation. These formations have allowed communities of researchers who share basic theoretical assumptions to build distinctive bodies of knowledge about surveillance's purpose and consequences. We propose an ironic approach that allows us to consider the coercive and caring aspects of organization surveillance together--a move that, by acknowledging ambiguity and paradox, allows a dialogue to develop between the two research communities.</p>

            <p>Integrating merged businesses to realize synergies can adversely affect the distribution of potential outcomes through two mechanisms: the contagion effect and the capacity effect. I describe these effects, highlight when they will be pronounced, and discuss their importance. My arguments demonstrate that an inherent element of synergy-based mergers and acquisitions is that actions to facilitate synergy capture can amplify threats and can inhibit firms' ability to respond to favorable conditions in the business environment.</p>

            <p>Idiosyncratic employment arrangements (i-deals) stand to benefit the individual employee as well as his or her employer. However, unless certain conditions apply, coworkers may respond negatively to these arrangements. We distinguish functional i-deals from their dysfunctional counterparts and highlight evidence of i-deals in previous organizational research. We develop propositions specifying both how i-deals are formed and how they impact workers and coworkers. Finally, we outline the implications i-deals have for research and for managing contemporary employment relationships.</p>
            <p>Modular design practices provide a lens on the link among product architecture, imitation, and the dynamic capabilities that sustain long-term performance. Looking at closed product systems, we propose that simplified links between design and performance outcomes in modular environments facilitate imitation. The same reduction in complexity drives development of dynamic capabilities. These take the form of more rapid and reliable search processes for incremental and radical innovations. The scope and timing of a firm's modular strategy influence the development of these capabilities, which are critical to sustainable modular performance advantages.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework of individual error reporting that draws from research on human error, learning, discretionary behaviors, and high-reliability organizations. The framework describes three phases that underlie error reporting: error detection, situation assessment, and choice of behavioral response. We discuss theoretical implications of the framework and directions for future research.</p>
            <p>Instead of paradigmatic unity, we call for progressive theory development from a set of core concepts (Lakatos, 1970) comprising primacy of relations, ubiquity of embeddedness, social utility of connections, and structural patterning of social life. Organizational network research can capture complexity and distinctiveness of individuals and networks in terms of mutual constitution and change. The goal is not to delineate small puzzles whose outcomes are predetermined but to signal bold ideas concerning new phenomena.</p>

In order to reach this goal, the model extends the range of current theory beyond internal organizational members, linking CEO charisma to those outsiders key to organizational effectiveness: institutional intermediaries and external stakeholders. We discuss several implications suggested by this framework to facilitate future research in this area.</p>

            <p>We draw on industrial-organization economics theory, density-dependent and resource-partitioning theories, and brand-leveraging theories to propose a product-level theory of market entry. The result is a more fully informed account of the relationship between the firm and its ability to shape its market environment. Our core thesis is that the relationship between product proliferation and new product entry is an inverted U, which itself is moderated by the extent of brand name sharing among incumbent products.</p>

We then analyze three major dimensions through which telecommuting alters the social context of work and interaction (location of work, time spent telecommuting, and voluntary nature) and discuss the implications of telecommuting within the identity-based framework. Finally, we explore the implications that telecommuting has for identity-related theories.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this research was to explore how the pace, sequence, and linearity of change can affect the outcome of radical transformations. Real-time data collected over 12 years showed that, contrary to popular belief, wide-scale rapid change was not a determining factor. However, early change to specific "high-impact" elements was found to be necessary for completing radical transitions. Further, analysis conducted at the suborganization level provided insight into the ways in which change unfurls in a nonlinear manner.</p>
            <p>Previous work on service performance has focused on either organization- or individual-level analysis. This multilevel study of 257 employees, 44 managers, and 1,993 customers from 25 restaurants demonstrated that both individual- and store-level factors were significantly associated with employee service performance: conscientiousness and extraversion explained within-store variance, and service climate and employee involvement explained between-store variance. Further, employee service performance aggregated to the store level explained between-store variance in customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
            <p>We show how award ceremony rituals influence organizational field evolution through four critical processes: distributing prestige in "situated" performances; enacting a highly charged ceremonial form designed to attract the collective attention of a field; serving as a medium for surfacing and resolving conflicts about the legitimacy of field participants; and tightening horizontal linkages within the field. Using the Grammy Awards as a case study, we present a mixed-method, longitudinal analysis of these processes operating in tandem.</p>

            <p>Our aim in this study was to extend theory on service climate by examining two boundary conditions for the effects of service climate on customer attitudes. We hypothesized that (1) the more proximal and relevant the target of a service climate (a subunit versus an organization as a whole) to customers, and (2) the higher the frequency of contact between employees and customers, the stronger would be the relationship between service climate and customer attitudes. Both hypotheses received support in a sample of 160 bank branches.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Applying institutional theory, we argue that environmentally legitimate firms incur less unsystematic stock market risk than illegitimate firms. Firms earn environmental legitimacy when their performance with respect to the natural environment conforms to stakeholders' expectations. This relationship was supported with the analysis of media reports and stock prices of 100 firms over a five-year period. The analysis also showed that firms with low environmental legitimacy can attenuate this effect by expressing commitment to the natural environment.</p>
            <p>March and Shapira's (1987, 1992) model of managers' risk preferences allows for shifts in attention between survival and aspiration levels. Our study provides initial empirical tests of their model using organizational data. We found that the variables affecting risk and the sizes (but not the signs) of these effects differed across performance categories. Organizations performing poorly showed increased risk as they neared bankruptcy. Other firms showed lower risk as performance improved relative to aspirations.</p>

            <p>The theory of multimarket contact has important but uninvestigated implications for interactions among a firm's divisions because divisions often meet and even compete in multiple geographical and product markets. I hypothesize that firms with incentives to induce competition among divisions will act to reduce levels of multimarket contact among those divisions. Further, I predict that, in markets with substantial uncertainty, firms will increase divisional multimarket contact. I find support for these hypotheses in the setting of the franchised fast-food industry.</p>
            <p>Examining a neglected issue, we investigated the relationships between employees' feeling mistreated, grievance filing, the nature of the perceived mistreatment, and employee withdrawal. Results indicated higher exit-related withdrawal for those who perceived mistreatment and higher work withdrawal behavior for those who experienced personalized mistreatment. Withdrawal measures for grievance filers were not significantly different from those for nonfilers when we accounted for the role of perceived mistreatment.</p>
            <p>We examined the neutralizing effects of political skill on relationships between perceived role conflict and strain. Strain was measured as psychological anxiety, somatic complaints, and physiological strain (heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure). Results support the moderating effects of political skill: greater political skill reduced the negative effects of role conflict on all types of strain.</p>
            <p>We investigated the relationship between team empowerment and virtual team performance and the moderating role of the extent of face-to-face interaction using 35 sales and service virtual teams in a high-technology organization. Team empowerment was positively related to two independent assessments of virtual team performance--process improvement and customer satisfaction. Further, the number of face-to-face meetings moderated the relationship between team empowerment and process improvement: team empowerment was a stronger predictor for teams that met face-to-face less, rather than more, frequently.</p>
            <p>Attitudes among 178 professional men and women working for a clothing manufacturer and retailer depended on their work groups' sex composition. Findings were consistent with status considerations: women expressed a greater likelihood of leaving homogeneous groups than did men, even though women expressed greater commitment, positive affect, and perceptions of cooperation when they worked in all-female groups. These results suggest that similarity-attraction may be inadequate as the primary theoretical foundation for understanding how work group sex composition influences men and women.</p>
            <p>We investigated contextual organizational ambidexterity, defined as the capacity to simultaneously achieve alignment and adaptability at a business-unit level. Building on the leadership and organization context literatures, we argue that a context characterized by a combination of stretch, discipline, support, and trust facilitates contextual ambidexterity. Further, ambidexterity mediates the relationship between these contextual features and performance. Data collected from 4,195 individuals in 41 business units supported our hypotheses.</p>

            <p>Uniting separate research streams on situational and dispositional goals, we investigated goal setting and goal orientation together in a complex business simulation. A specific learning goal led to higher performance than did either a specific performance goal or a vague goal. Goal orientation predicted performance when the goal was vague. The performance goal attenuated correlations between goal orientation and performance. The correlation between a learning goal orientation and performance was significant when a learning goal was set. Self-efficacy and information search mediated the effect of a learning goal on performance.</p>
            <p>Little is known about why some supply chains perform well while others do not. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm and theory from the information processing and organizational learning literatures, we devised a model linking knowledge development to cycle time in strategic supply chains--chains whose members are strategically, operationally, and technologically integrated. Using data from 58 chains in a "Fortune" 500 firm, we found that the knowledge development process explained substantial variance in cycle time.</p>
            <p>Extending previous theorizing on cultural diversity's organizational effects by integrating value-in-diversity and social identity perspectives with the framework of Blau's (1977) theory of heterogeneity, we hypothesized curvilinear relationships between racial and gender diversity in management and firm performance. We evaluated relationships within the context of firm-level entrepreneurial orientation. Our empirical study indicated complex relationships among study variables. It revealed that innovativeness positively and risk taking negatively moderated nonlinear relationship patterns for both racial and gender heterogeneity. Research and practical implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>We explore impression and earnings management via reasoning and methods grounded in ethnostatistics and agency theory. We hypothesized that earnings management occurs more frequently following duality-creating successions than otherwise because CEO-chairs have greater control of the impressions created by their firms' financial reports and are operating under greater expectations of positive results. Using a sample of 173 duality-creating succession announcements and 112 non-duality-creating succession announcements, we obtained empirical results consistent with these predictions.</p>
            <p>We tested the hypothesis that employee turnover and firm performance have an inverted U-shaped relationship: overly high or low turnover is harmful. Our analysis was based on economic performance data from 110 offices of a temporary employment agency. These offices had high variation in turnover but were otherwise similar, allowing control for important intervening variables. Regression analysis revealed a curvilinear relationship; high turnover was harmful, but the inverted U-shape was not observed with certainty.</p>
            <p>We extended past research on the display of positive emotions within customer service settings by focusing on customer traits. Adopting an emotional contagion perspective, we found that customer traits relate to the display of positive emotions by the service provider. This display of positive emotions was also found to relate to customer satisfaction. Implications for emotion management and service personnel training are discussed.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Does investing in employees' marketable skills reduce turnover? This study uses insights from human capital theory to explain how general skill development and promotion relate to voluntary turnover. Data from 9,439 salaried employees of a large manufacturer show that participation in tuition reimbursement reduces turnover while employees are in school. Voluntary turnover increases when individuals earn graduate degrees but is significantly reduced if they are subsequently promoted.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Most research to date has approached employee empowerment as an individual-level phenomenon. In this study we proposed a work-unit-level construct, empowerment climate, and tested a multiple-level model integrating macro and micro approaches to empowerment. Empowerment climate was shown to be empirically distinct from psychological empowerment and positively related to manager ratings of work-unit performance. A cross-level mediation analysis using hierarchical linear modeling showed that psychological empowerment mediated the relationships between empowerment climate and individual performance and job satisfaction.</p>
            <p>This research examined the relationship between employee personality and psychological contract type, perceptions of contract breach, and feelings of contract violation. In general, personality characteristics (extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, self-esteem, equity sensitivity, and locus of control) were related to reported contract type. They also tended to predict perceptions of contract breach and to moderate the relationship between those perceptions and feelings of contract violation. Both contract type and feelings of violation were associated with job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intentions to quit.</p>
            <p>As hypothesized, data from 170 employees of a Dutch firm showed that the quality of leader-member exchange mediated positive relationships between a mastery orientation and leader-rated in-role job performance, leader-rated innovative job performance, and job satisfaction. In contrast, a performance orientation was negatively related or unrelated to those outcomes. These findings suggest that employees with stronger mastery orientations are more effective on the job because they tend to establish higher-quality exchanges with their supervisors.</p>
            <p>A high level of trust can make the members of self-managing work teams reluctant to monitor one another. If low monitoring combines with high individual autonomy, team performance can suffer. Data from 71 self-managing teams of MBA students demonstrated this effect. High trust was associated with higher team performance when individual autonomy was low but with lower performance when individual autonomy was high. Additional analysis showed a moderated mediating role of monitoring and autonomy in the relationship between trust and performance.</p>
            <p>Using data on 935 small firms and bank managers, we differentiated customers' relational trust in their banks from beliefs about the banks' self-interested motivations. Relational trust mediated the relationship between bank strategies (customer orientation and manager continuity) and the likelihood a firm would switch banks, and the effect of trust went beyond that of beliefs about self-interest. Further, customer orientation reduced bank switching through relational trust, whereas manager continuity operated on switching both directly and through relational trust.</p>
            <p>With globalization, understanding unethical conduct from a cross-national perspective is becoming more important. We used institutional anomie theory to develop hypotheses relating four national culture variables (achievement, individualism, universalism, and pecuniary materialism) and social institutions (economy, polity, family, and education) to managers' willingness to justify behaviors generally considered ethically suspect. Data from 3,450 managers from 28 countries support our hypotheses for universalism, pecuniary materialism, economy, family, and education. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>
            <p>We explored the role of goal setting in motivating unethical behavior in a laboratory experiment. We found that people with unmet goals were more likely to engage in unethical behavior than people attempting to do their best. This relationship held for goals both with and without economic incentives. We also found that the relationship between goal setting and unethical behavior was particularly strong when people fell just short of reaching their goals.</p>
            <p>Expanding a conceptual framework, we differentiated services on the basis of their levels of captivity (the difficulty of a customer's leaving) and intensity (the number of services performed), arguing that context is especially critical to service delivery when these levels are high. Data from cruise ships generally supported our hypotheses. We report effects of physical and social context on evaluations made by passengers, industry experts, and government regulators. Implications for managers of other service settings are discussed.</p>
            <p>We examined how social capital and the power of venture capitalists founder-CEOs affect IPO firm survival. Using data from 218 U.S. initial public offerings conducted in 1992, we found that average management team tenure and an IPO deal's network embeddedness decreased the likelihood of failure during a firm's first five years as a public entity. Founder-CEO presence at the time of an IPO interacted with CEO ownership to decrease the likelihood of failure, and CEO ownership and venture capitalist ownership concentration also decreased that likelihood.</p>
            <p>Taking an organizational learning and adaptation perspective, we compared "relay" CEO successions with nonrelay inside successions and outside successions. Data on 204 CEO successions between 1993 and 1998 in nondiversified U.S. manufacturing firms showed that the likelihood of relay succession was negatively associated with the number of internal candidates and positively associated with presuccession firm performance. We also found that relay successions led to better postsuccession firm performance, particularly at lower levels of presuccession firm performance and higher levels of postsuccession strategic and industry instability.</p>

            <p>We investigated how the knowledge capabilities of industry incumbents affected the generation, development, and performance of "spin-outs" (entrepreneurial ventures of ex-employees). Analyses of 1977-97 data from the disk drive industry supported our hypothesis that incumbents with both strong technological and market pioneering know-how generate fewer spin-outs than firms with strength in only one of these areas. Also, an incumbent's capabilities at the time of a spin-out's founding positively affect the spin-out's knowledge capabilities and its probability of survival.</p>

            <p>This longitudinal, qualitative study examined "sensemaking" during an imposed shift from hierarchical to decentralized organization. We identified a "replacement" pattern of schema development in which middle managers moved from shared through clustered sensemaking, to shared but differentiated sensemaking. Our findings provide evidence that different change processes lead to different patterns of schema development. Further, they highlight the socially negotiated nature of schema change and the significance of middle managers' lateral social interactions in shaping change in the absence of senior management.</p>
            <p>In a longitudinal field experiment, we examined the generalizability of the "Galatea effect" to businesses. This constructive replication provides the first test of the effect of a nonfictitious, nontraining intervention on actual job performance of new and established professionals. To examine duration, we measured the effect on performance until it disappeared for the sample as a whole. The Galatea intervention bolstered self-efficacy, motivation, and performance, though this latter effect was temporary. We also partially confirmed the "self-fulfilling prophecy at work model" and suggest possible extensions.</p>

            <p>Process models of turnover focus on how people quit; content models focus on why. To integrate these approaches and test whether motives relate systematically to decision processes, we classified 159 leavers using four process types and measured eight content motives for leaving. One key finding was that those who quit with no job alternative had more negative affect than users of other decision types, suggesting affect-driven, impulsive quitting. Results suggest that process-content integration is a fruitful direction for turnover research.</p>
            <p>With a sample of new technology ventures in China, we investigated the contingent effect of strategic decision comprehensiveness on new product performance and product quality. The relationship between strategic decision comprehensiveness and new product performance was negatively moderated by technology uncertainty but positively moderated by demand uncertainty. The effect of decision comprehensiveness on new product quality was positively moderated by demand uncertainty but unaffected by technology uncertainty. The comprehensiveness-performance link emerges as more complex than previous research has shown.</p>
            <p>A proposed theoretical framework for the study of multinationality and performance includes both benefits and costs of geographic expansion over different phases of internationalization. Data on 1,489 Japanese firms over 12 years show a consistent horizontal X S-shaped X relationship between multinationality and performance. Further, firms investing more heavily in intangible assets, such as technology and advertising, achieved greater profitability gains from growth in foreign direct investment. Our framework and findings highlight complexity and temporal dynamics.</p>

            <p>We tested the empirical validity of integrative social contracts theory by comparing the responses on an ethics survey of Americans working in Russia and in the United States. "Hypernorms" and "local norms" moderated the effect of national context on ethical evaluations and intended behaviors. In hypernorm situations, location played little role: all respondents shared similar ethical attitudes. In local norm situations, however, attitudes diverged. Our findings support the hypothesis that integrative social contracts theory can explain how expatriates evaluate ethical dilemmas abroad.</p>

            <p>We propose that executive team power strengthens a cycle of "homosocial reproduction" that is interrupted only when teams face such compelling needs for diversity as poor organizational performance, high corporate diversification, and tough market competition. Hypothesis tests in data from major Dutch newspaper publishers over 25 years did not support many of our benchmark expectations. Apparently, top management teams tend to close ranks when environmental complexity and pressure increase. Explanations and new research avenues are discussed.</p>

            <p>In a qualitative study of the emerging field of HIV/AIDS treatment advocacy in Canada, we found that institutional entrepreneurship involved three sets of critical activities: (1) the occupation of "subject positions" that have wide legitimacy and bridge diverse stakeholders, (2) the theorization of new practices through discursive and political means, and (3) the institutionalization of these new practices by connecting them to stakeholders' routines and values.</p>

            <p>This study tested whether teams working on a command and control simulation adapted to structural change in the manner implied by contingency theories. Teams shifting from a functional to a divisional structure showed better performance than teams making a divisional-to-functional shift. Team levels of coordination mediated this difference, and team levels of cognitive ability moderated it. We argue that the static logic behind many contingency theories should be complemented with a dynamic logic challenging the assumption of symmetrical adaptation.</p>
            <p>This study examined the impact of surface- and deep-level cultural differences on the cross-cultural adjustment of expatriates. Surface-level differences concern easily visible dissimilarities between home and host countries, and deep-level differences refer to dissimilarities in basic values. Overall, results indicated that surface-level cultural differences were most strongly related to general adjustment. Deep-level cultural differences regarding the "self-transcendence" value dimension were related to work and interaction adjustment.</p>
            <p>This study extends theory and research on job embeddedness, which was disaggregated into its two major subdimensions, on-the-job and off-the-job embeddedness. As hypothesized, regression analyses revealed that off-the-job embeddedness was significantly predictive of subsequent "voluntary turnover" and volitional absences, whereas on-the-job embeddedness was not. Also as hypothesized, on-the-job embeddedness was significantly predictive of organizational citizenship and job performance, whereas off-the-job embeddedness was not. In addition, embeddedness moderated the effects of absences, citizenship, and performance on turnover. Implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>Guided by two competing theoretical perspectives, we investigated effects of structure on performance and human resource outcomes of general hospitals. Neither a product-line nor a functional structure was associated with the performance outcomes of service quality and innovation. However, the product-line structure was negatively associated with the human resource outcomes, professional development, and job satisfaction. In line with the professional autonomy perspective, our results raise questions about the appropriateness of a product-line structure for professional organizations.</p>
            <p>This study analyzed the relationship between social capital and knowledge creation at the individual level. Our limited theory of knowledge creation encompasses the number and strength of the relationships that a person maintains. Hypothesis tests in a sample of biomedical research scientists strongly supported predictions. As relationships increased in number, returns to knowledge creation diminished. Increased interactions with a single other showed a similar effect. The strength of interpersonal relations had a higher marginal effect on knowledge creation than the number of relations.</p>

            <p>This study analyzes the determinants of global standardization of multinational companies' environmental policies. Survey data from the chemical industry show that MNCs standardize different environmental policy dimensions in response to pressures from different external stakeholders. MNC characteristics also affect environmental policy standardization. Findings demonstrate that the nature of stakeholder demands affects firms' responses to stakeholder pressures. Because environmental policy standardization reduces MNCs' ability to exploit cross-country differences in environmental regulations, these findings also have important implications for the self-regulation of MNCs' environmental conduct.</p>
            <p>Previous research on interpersonal interactions has found inconsistent effects of hostile interpersonal behaviors on organizational outcomes. This study found that technical performance by service providers and customer utility for service moderated the relations between hostile behaviors of service providers and service quality. Hostile behavior is most detrimental to service quality when customers have a high utility for service interactions and experience poor technical performance. These relations were found to be mediated by customer experiences of hostility.</p>
            <p>The central argument of network research is that actors are embedded in networks of interconnected social relationships that offer opportunities for and constraints on behavior. We review research on the antecedents and consequences of networks at the interpersonal, interunit, and interorganizational levels of analysis, evaluate recent theoretical and empirical trends, and give directions for future research, highlighting the importance of investigating cross-level network phenomena.</p>
            <p>I examine how firms use alliances to respond to the alliance networks of their rivals, by either allying with their rivals' partners or by building countervailing alliances. Evidence from the global airline industry (1994-98) suggests that these strategic responses depend on alliance cospecialization. Cospecialized alliances by rivals may involve exclusivity, precluding alliances with the rivals' partners and thus encouraging countervailing alliances. Nonspecialized alliances are less exclusive and are used when rivals share the same partners.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the effects of partner substitutability and alliance network structure on organizational profitability. Although firms are expected to benefit from the exclusive resources brought in by resource-rich, nonsubstitutable alliance partners, the costs of allying with such partners could offset those benefits. Analyzing alliances in the U.S. telecommunications industry, we show that a firm facing nonsubstitutable partners was better off when its alliances were embedded in third-party ties, which allowed the firm to gain indirect leverage on such partners.</p>

            <p>This study introduces the concept of group social capital, which is the configuration of group members' social relationships within a group and in the social structure of a broader organization, and tests the proposition that group effectiveness is maximized via optimal configurations of different conduits for such capital. These conduits include intragroup closure relationships and bridging relationships that span vertical and horizontal intergroup boundaries. Results from our 60-team field study of informal socializing ties provide empirical support.</p>

            <p>We examined how network structure (density overlap and embeddedness) and technology characteristics of a platform (dominance and newness) shaped interorganizational coordination of product launches in the U.S. video game industry. We found that the developers' choices to launch games for particular game consoles were significantly explained by these four factors using multiprobability regression on a primary data set of 2,815 launches between 1995 and 2002. This analysis was complemented with application of a network visualization technique.</p>

            <p>Investigating the efficacy of two alternative network structures, closure and structural holes, from the contingent perspective of time, we connect past and current social structures to outcomes. We show that, in the Italian television production industry, current structural holes rather than past ones, but past closure rather than current closure, help current network performance. Thus, structural holes and closure are both valuable, but at different points in time.</p>

            <p>This research shows that alliance networks shape how firms respond to uncertainty-reducing information generated outside a network. Product awards signal the potential commercial success of the award-winning firms, which reduces the uncertainty of new R&amp;D investment. Networks magnify or diminish a firm's R&amp;D response to the market signals, depending on the firm's network location, partners' success, technical proximity to partners, and relative capabilities. The study examined 198 U.S. computer and telecommunications firms from 1991 to 2000.</p>
            <p>Triadic structure is an important, but neglected, aspect of interfirm networks. We developed the constructs clustering and countering as potential drivers of triadic structure and combined them with the recently developed p* network model to demonstrate the value and feasibility of triadic analysis. Exploratory analysis of data from the global steel industry revealed firms' tendency to form transitive triads, in which three firms all have direct ties with each other, especially within blocks defined by geography or technology.</p>

            <p>We argue that individual performance in knowledge-intensive work is associated with properties of both networks and ties. Relationships crossing organizational boundaries, physical barriers, or hierarchical levels can, like networks, provide unique information and diverse perspectives to individuals completing tasks at work. Egocentric and bounded network data from 101 engineers in a petrochemical company and 125 consultants in a strategy-consulting firm support our contention that both networks and ties are related to individual performance in knowledge-intensive work.</p>
            <p>Computational modeling simulated innovation diffusion through six prototypical interregional network structures and two distributions of partnering tendencies in dynamic organizational fields. Compared to regional constraints, connections among all geographic regions decreased clearly beneficial innovation diffusion (a low-threshold adoption model) but increased ambiguous innovation diffusion (a social influence model). Compared with uniform partnering tendencies, normally distributed partnering tendencies increased diffusion of ambiguous innovations. Overall, local and interregional network structures interacted with the observability of an innovation's benefits to determine diffusion.</p>
            <p>Drawing on social exchange and similarity-attraction theories, we hypothesized that individuals' demographic characteristics, values, and personality influence their acquisition of central positions in their teams' social networks. Education and neuroticism predicted centrality five months later; individuals who were highly educated and low in neuroticism became high in advice and friendship centrality and low in adversarial centrality. Team members' values similarity to their teammates also predicted advice and friendship centrality; demographic similarity had limited effects.</p>
            <p>
            <p>A longitudinal study of the social processes of organizational sensemaking suggests that they unfold in four distinct forms: guided, fragmented, restricted, and minimal. These forms result from the degree to which leaders and stakeholders engage in "sensegiving"--attempts to influence others' understandings of an issue. Each of the four forms of organizational sensemaking is associated with a distinct set of process characteristics that capture the dominant pattern of interaction. They also each result in particular outcomes, specifically, the nature of the accounts and actions generated.</p>
            <p>We propose four alternative predictions regarding the relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance and develop the hypothesis that safety and productivity outcomes mediate that relationship. In two intraindustry studies, strong support emerged for curvilinearity: the relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance is negative, but it is attenuated as turnover increases. Some modest support for workforce performance as a mediator of the voluntary turnover and financial performance relationship emerged. Implications for organization-level theory and research are addressed.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Extending Hambrick's (1994) concept of behavioral integration, a meta-construct of top management team process, we theorized on the extent to which CEO-, team-, and firm-level determinants shape behavioral integration. Using survey data from 402 firms, we developed a reliable measure of the construct and found strong support for our structural model. Although determinants at each level explained some variance in behavioral integration, considering all three levels in concert explained the most variance.</p>

            <p>Integrating multiple theoretical perspectives, we differentiated international experience into current and past experience. In addition, we organized past international experience along two dimensions: domain (work/travel) and cultural specificity (U.S./non-U.S.). We examined the effects of expatriates' current assignment experience and past international experience on cross-cultural adjustment. The results indicate that past international experience moderates the relationship between current assignment tenure and general and work adjustment and also that general and work adjustment directly affect expatriates' early return intentions.</p>
            <p>This study tested a multilevel model of newcomer adaptation in teams using longitudinal and multisource data from 65 project teams. Results indicated that newcomer performance improved over time, particularly early in socialization. Initial newcomer empowerment, team expectations, and team performance differently predicted newcomer initial performance and performance improvement. In turn, newcomer initial performance and performance improvement uniquely related to subsequent team performance, and newcomer initial performance related to subsequent newcomer empowerment and intentions to quit.</p>
            <p>Two qualitative studies in the U.K. health care sector trace eight purposefully selected innovations. Complex, contested, and nonlinear innovation careers emerged. Developing the nonlinear perspective on innovation spread further, we theorize that multi-professionalization shapes "nonspread." Social and cognitive boundaries between different professions retard spread, as individual professionals operate within unidisciplinary communities of practice. This new theory helps explain barriers to the spread of innovation in multiprofessional organizations in both health care and other settings.</p>
            <p>There has been growing interest in the degree to which human resource systems contribute to organizational effectiveness, yet limited research attention has been paid to the contextual conditions that moderate the efficacy of these practices. In this study, we examined how industry characteristics affect the relative importance and value of high-performance work systems. Findings indicate that the impact of these human resources systems on productivity is influenced by industry capital intensity, growth, and differentiation.</p>

            <p>This study extends prior research on the chain of relationships among organizational justice, social exchange relationships, and employee reactions by investigating the proposed mediating role of psychological contract violations. Results obtained from a longitudinal design examining a sample of 191 employees provide strong support for the proposal, enhance support for chain directionality, validate theoretical predictions about determinants of contract violations, and provide initial evidence supporting a proposed integration of perceived organizational support and psychological contract theory.</p>
            <p>Over 1,000 U.S. Army officers responded to two surveys over a two-year period. Results indicated that mentoring was positively related to affective commitment and continuance commitment and negatively related to "turnover behavior." The relationship with affective commitment was moderated by the conditions of mentorship (supervisory versus nonsupervisory) but not by the type of mentoring support provided (career-related versus psychosocial). Affective commitment partially mediated the negative relationship between mentoring and actual turnover behavior ten years later.</p>
            <p>Integrating social psychological and network theory, this field study demonstrates a positive association between identity confirmation--based networks and cooperation and performance in work groups. Mutual identity confirmation (of positive and negative identities) increased cooperation in work group dyads. With position in conventional social networks controlled, structural equivalence in identity confirmation networks also increased cooperation. Advantageous positions in identity confirmation networks enhanced performance through greater cooperation, and identity confirmation mediated effects of race-based diversity.</p>

            <p>Through studying joint ventures during the early (1993) and late phases (2001) of Hungary's economic transition to market economy, we demonstrate how institutional and economic transformation alters foreign parents' roles in the success of joint ventures. Foreign parent decision influence and resource provision affected market performance and knowledge acquisition differently in the two phases. We conjecture that the value of foreign partner involvement in a transition economy depends in part on the maturity of the transition.</p>
            <p>To test a model of interfirm competition for human resources, firms' responses to the loss of employees to single rivals were examined. Results suggest that attributes of hiring firms and of hired employees are associated with target firms' decisions to defend and retaliate against labor market rivals. The findings have implications for the validation of intrafirm differences in human resource systems. This study opens the door for further theorizing and modeling of interfirm competition for intangible resources.</p>

            <p>Integrating work on international assignments and domestic stress, we conducted meta-analyses of over 50 determinants and consequences of expatriate adjustment using data from 8,474 expatriates in 66 studies. We also examined the trajectory of adjustment over time, and time as a moderator of adjustment effects. Results emphasize the centrality, criticality, and complexity of adjustment, strongly supporting Black, Mendenhall, and Oddou's (1991) model. Structural modeling of proposed model extensions showed that adjustment uniquely affects job satisfaction, withdrawal cognitions, and performance.</p>

            <p>In this study, we (1) clarify and distinguish the concept of status, (2) identify and analyze the institutional and organizational factors that can lead to differences in organizational status over time, and (3) empirically assess the privileges implied by such differences. Using extensive longitudinal data on competitive intercollegiate athletics, we found that status was a significant predictor of whether a college was invited to participate in the NCAA postseason basketball tournament, independently of performance considerations.</p>

            <p>This study distinguishes alternative competitive and institutional explanations of interorganizational mimicry by examining the clustering of U.S. telecommunications firms' 1995-95 moves into other Western Hemisphere countries. Mimicry of entry moves was more likely when both a focal firm and prior movers had large shares in the same domestic markets. More mimicry occurred among oligopolistic long-distance firms than among monopolistic local-exchange phone companies. Thus, mimetic international entry was strongly linked to the structure of domestic competition.</p>

            <p>We investigated how demographic differences affected people's responses to organizational cues to cooperate with their coworkers. Officers from a large financial services firm who were more demographically different from their coworkers behaved more cooperatively when their business unit emphasized collectivistic rather than individualistic cultural values. Our results imply that understanding and managing cooperative behavior requires considering the interplay between relational demography and organizational culture.</p>
            <p>Drawing on the organizational learning literature, we posited that both general, diverse-partner experience and partner-specific experience contribute to alliance performance, but at a declining rate. We tested hypotheses in unique data on the objective performance of projects between large pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology partners. The general alliance experience of the biotechnology partners, but not of the pharmaceutical firms, positively affected joint project performance. This relationship exhibited diminishing marginal returns. Contrary to predictions, partner-specific experience had a negative, marginally significant effect on joint project performance.</p>

            <p>A field study of top management teams and knowledge workers from 72 technology firms demonstrated that the rate of new product and service introduction was a function of organization members' ability to combine and exchange knowledge. We tested the following as bases of that ability: the existing knowledge of employees (their education levels and functional heterogeneity), knowledge from member ego networks (number of direct contacts and strength of ties), and organizational climates for risk taking and teamwork.</p>

            <p>Previous sexual harassment research and theory have focused primarily upon the individual level, with little attention to team- or organization-level outcomes. In this article, we extend research on outcomes associated with sexual harassment to the team level with an examination of the relationships between team ambient sexual harassment, team conflict, team cohesion, team citizenship behaviors, and team financial performance. Practical implications and a multilevel model to guide future sexual harassment research are offered.</p>

            <p>This study examined relationships among remote work, demographic dissimilarity, social network centrality, and the use and effectiveness of impression management behaviors. In our findings, a higher proportion of time spent working remotely from supervisors increased the frequency of supervisor- and job-focused impression management, but reduced social network centrality decreased job-focused impression management. Social network centrality moderated the relationships between job-focused impression management and both remote work and sex dissimilarity. Sex dissimilarity intensified a negative association between job-focused impression management and performance appraisal. Both sex dissimilarity and network centrality enhanced the positive association between supervisor-focused impression management and performance appraisal.</p>
            <p>We developed a model in which leader-member exchange mediated between perceived transformational leadership behaviors and followers' task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors. Our sample comprised 162 leader-follower dyads within organizations situated throughout the People's Republic of China. We showed that leader-member exchange fully mediated between transformational leadership and task performance as well as organizational citizenship behaviors. Implications for the theory and practice of leadership are discussed, and future research directions offered.</p>
            <p>How can one predict entrepreneurship, an individual's participation in the founding of a new organization? We propose that the organizational context of an individual either accelerates or retards the likelihood of entrepreneurship, depending on the individual's role in the organization. The effects of role hinge, we argue, on the founder's charismatic identity, and the decoupling of this identity from the organization as it ages and grows. Our findings support the proposition that organizational properties that affect the likelihood of becoming an entrepreneur do so in opposite ways for organizational members and founders. We discuss how our theory and results demonstrate the value of a sociological perspective on entrepreneurship.</p>

            <p>We examined how aspects of intellectual capital influenced various innovative capabilities in organizations. In a longitudinal, multiple-informant study of 93 organizations, we found that human, organizational, and social capital and their interrelationships selectively influenced incremental and radical innovative capabilities. As anticipated, organizational capital positively influenced incremental innovative capability, while human capital interacted with social capital to positively influence radical innovative capability. Counter to our expectations, however, human capital by itself was negatively associated with radical innovative capability. Interestingly, social capital played a significant role in both types of innovation, as it positively influenced incremental and radical innovative capabilities.</p>
            <p>This paper provides an inductive theoretical framework that explains how and why vertical disintegration happens, showing that transaction costs are an incidental feature of industry evolution. I find that gains from intrafirm specialization set off a process of intraorganizational partitioning, which simplifies coordination along parts of the value chain. Likewise, latent gains from trade foster interfirm cospecialization, which leads to information standardization. Given standardized information and simplified coordination, new intermediate markets emerge, breaking up the value chain, allowing new types of vertically specialized firms to participate in an industry, and changing the industry's competitive landscape.</p>

            <p>In a sample of Canadian investment bank cliques from 1952 to 1990, we examined whether social similarity and cohesion reduced exits of members from these cliques; whether complementarity through differentiated roles reduced such exits; and whether inequality in structural holes increased exits. We found that complementarity and inequality were more powerful antecedents of clique exits than similarity and cohesion. Our results suggest that clique stability is a function of three social and instrumental processes: building social attraction to govern exchanges, developing complementarity to accomplish collaborative tasks, and distributing the value created by a clique among its members.</p>
            <p>We examine relationships between creativity, the use of standardized work practices, and effectiveness (measured as both performance and customer satisfaction) among 90 empowered teams of service technicians. Despite the seemingly contradictory natures of creativity and standardized procedures, our results indicate that they can be complementary. Specifically, standardization was found to moderate the relationship between creativity and both team performance and customer satisfaction, although the pattern of results differed for the two measures of effectiveness. We discuss how and when teams can effectively employ both work practices.</p>
            <p>In multidisciplinary teams in the oil and gas industry, we examined expertise diversity's relationship with team learning and team performance under varying levels of collective team identification. In teams with low collective identification, expertise diversity was negatively related to team learning and performance; where team identification was high, those relationships were positive. Results also supported nonlinear relationships between expertise diversity and both team learning and performance. Finally, team learning partially mediated the linear and nonlinear relationships between diversity and performance. Findings broaden understanding of the process by which and the conditions under which expertise diversity may promote team performance.</p>

            <p>This study provides evidence regarding the strategic dynamics of competitive clusters. Firms that agglomerate (co-locate) may benefit from the differentiation of competitors without making similar differentiating investments themselves. Alternatively, co-locating with a high percentage of firms with low-cost strategic orientations reduces performance for firms pursuing high levels of differentiation. Further, the lowest-cost providers with the greatest strategic distance from the norm of the competitive cluster reap the greatest benefit from co-location with differentiated firms. We find empirical support for these ideas using a sample of 14,995 U.S. lodging establishments, and controlling for a number of key demand-shaping factors.</p>
            <p>A congruence model of organizational design suggests that direct reporting relationships between plant managers and environmental quality managers, monetary incentives for environmental performance, and coordination between environmental quality managers and business strategists reduce plant-level toxic emissions. We tested these relationships in a large sample of U.S. electronics facilities. Only a link between plant manager compensation and environmental performance reduced emissions. Subsequent analyses support a reverse causality, suggesting organizational characteristics result from (rather than cause) emissions performance and that firms remain reactive on environmental issues. These findings confront theories of environmental management and congruence with provocative questions, which we discuss in depth.</p>

            <p>A theory of turnover, social capital losses, and store performance was developed and tested in 38 locations of a restaurant chain. We assessed the ability of social capital losses to predict variance in store-level performance above and beyond that predicted by overall turnover rate and in-role performance losses from turnover. We further predicted that turnover rate and network density would moderate the curvilinear relationship between social capital losses and performance. Results strongly supported turnover rate's moderation of social capital losses: performance declines from network disruptions were more apparent when overall turnover was low. The network density interaction prediction was not supported.</p>
            <p>This study examined whether structural, attitudinal, and behavioral variables of a relational nature were predictive of employee turnover. Participants were a sample of 176 health care employees from a large public medical center. Using survival analysis over a five-year time frame, we found that two such variables, network centrality and interpersonal citizenship behavior, predicted turnover. Implications of taking a relational perspective toward turnover and other withdrawal behaviors found in organizations are discussed.</p>
            <p>Dividends from employee diversity may require intergroup knowledge and information sharing, which in turn may depend on supportive peer relations. Yet little is known about the antecedents of such supportive relations among the racially dissimilar. We posited that the relative prevalence of supportive relations among dissimilar peers will be higher in work units with high task interdependence and a strong peer support climate but will decline as the proportion of racially different others increases (a "homophily" effect). An inverse relationship between the proportion of racially different others and supportive relations among whites and blacks was found; it was curvilinear and moderated by support climate.</p>
            <p>We investigated the effects of intragroup and cross-subgroup communications in an experimental field study on demographic faultlines. The results indicated that faultlines explained more variance in perceptions of team learning, psychological safety, satisfaction, and expected performance than single-attribute heterogeneity indexes. In addition, cross-subgroup work communications were effective for groups with weak faultlines but not for groups with strong faultlines. Overall, this study extends the original faultline model, documents the utility of the concept of faultlines, and identifies some of their effects on work group outcomes.</p>

            <p>Empirical findings from publicly traded firms and behavioral arguments suggest a positive influence of resource slack on financial performance. While this area has remained unexplored in privately held firms, conceptual arguments indicate that resource constraints may enhance performance. Longitudinal data on 900 privately held firms confirm the differing influences of forms of slack on performance. Results indicate that a combination of behavioral and resource constraints arguments are necessary to explain the slack-performance relationship in privately held firms. The implications of these findings for theories of resources and entrepreneurship are discussed.</p>
            <p>We investigated variation in how deadlines are experienced based on whether they match culturally entrained milestones. Consequences for task performance were also examined. We manipulated starting times on two experimental tasks as prototypical (e.g., 4:00 p.m.) or atypical (e.g., 4:07 p.m). In one experiment, each of 20 task groups was to create a television commercial in one hour. Groups' time pacing and performance varied significantly, and groups with prototypical starting times performed better. In a second experiment, 73 individuals were to divide time equally between two tasks. Individuals with atypical starting times performed more poorly on their second tasks.</p>
            <p>Building on the "loose coupling" logic, this study examines the importance of boundary spanners' shared perceptions of procedural justice in cross-cultural cooperative alliances. I argue that alliance profitability is higher when both parties perceive high rather than low procedural justice. Profitability is also higher when both parties' perceptions are high than when one party perceives high procedural justice but the other perceives low procedural justice. Shared justice perceptions become even more important for alliance profitability when the cultural distance between partners is high or when the industry of operation is uncertain. Analysis of 124 cross-cultural alliances in China supports these propositions.</p>

A discrete-choice model was tested in the wireless telecommunications industry.</p>

            <p>I work to unbundle the structure of inertia into two distinct categories: resource rigidity (failure to change resource investment patterns) and routine rigidity (failure to change organizational processes that use those resources). Given discontinuous change, a researcher's failure to recognize these distinctions can generate conflicting findings regarding effects of threat perception on inertia. Using field data on the response of newspaper organizations to the rise of digital media, I show that a strong perception of threat helps overcome resource rigidity but simultaneously amplifies routine rigidity. I develop an interpretive model exploring mechanisms for overcoming these divergent behaviors.</p>

            <p>This article reports a meta-analytic test of a two-dimensional work stressor framework with respect to stressors' relationships with strains, motivation, and performance. Hindrance stressors had a negative direct effect on performance, as well as negative indirect effects on performance through strains and motivation. Challenge stressors had a positive direct effect on performance, as well as offsetting indirect effects on performance through strains (negative) and motivation (positive). Results suggest research and practice could benefit by distinguishing among challenge and hindrance stressors.</p>

            <p>Different subsets of social networks may explain knowledge sharing outcomes in different ways. One subset may counteract another subset, and one subset may explain one outcome but not another. We found support for these arguments in an analysis of a sample of 121 new-product development teams. Within-team and interunit networks had different effects on the outcomes of three knowledge-sharing phases: deciding whether to seek knowledge across subunits, search costs, and costs of transfers. These results suggest that research on knowledge sharing can be advanced by studying how multiple networks affect various phases of knowledge sharing.</p>

            <p>We develop the concept of factional groups, or those in which members are representatives from a small number of (often just two) social entities. Such groups include many merger integration teams, bilateral task forces, and joint venture teams. We extend theory about group demography by arguing that factional groups possess preexisting faultlines that require a new conception of demographic dissimilarity. We propose that large demographic faultlines between factions engender task conflict, emotional conflict, and behavioral disintegration--which in turn lead to poor performance. We tested our model using data from 71 joint venture management groups. Data gathered in two waves strongly supported our propositions.</p>

            <p>We extend the resource-based perspective to explain innovation in new firms that have yet to develop resources. Using data on firms' efforts to commercialize technological inventions, we tested a model of the environmental conditions under which new firms' lack of resources alternately promotes or constrains innovation. We found that new firm innovation is greater in competitive and small markets, and in environments that do not demand extensive production assets.</p>
            <p>We conducted two studies that bring communities into the study of organizational demographics. Reasoning from a realistic group conflict theory base, we predicted (1) negative white reactions to racial and ethnic diversity in organizations and (2) moderation of this relationship by whites' diversity experiences in their communities. Data from the National Organizations Study and an experiment supported our hypotheses. The closer whites lived to blacks (Study 1) and the more interethnic conflict the former perceived in their communities (Study 2), the more negatively they responded to diverse workplaces. Our discussion focuses on understanding organizations as reflections of their environments.</p>

            <p>This study of 145 managers of a large biotechnology/agricultural company examined how leaders' emotion recognition ability and personality characteristics influenced performance of transformational leadership behavior. Emotion recognition, positive affectivity, and agreeableness positively predicted such behavior. In addition, extra-version moderated the relationship between emotion recognition and transformational leadership. We also provided construct validity evidence for transformational leadership behavior by showing differing effects of these antecedents on contingent reward behavior. The study provides empirical support for the contribution of emotion and personality to transformational leadership behavior.</p>

            <p>Following from research on firms' upper echelons, this article examines the previously unstudied issue of how technological dynamism moderates the relationship between a CEO's time in office and company inventive activities. We evaluate this relationship in the biopharmaceutical industry, a technology- and invention-intensive context. As would be expected from notions of a CEO life cycle, our results indicate a curvilinear, inverted U-shaped overall relationship between CEO tenure and invention. But technological dynamism shifts this curve in such a way that short-tenured CEOs engender more invention under highly dynamic technological environments, while long-tenured CEOs spur greater invention under more stable technologies.</p>

            <p>We argue that team information acquisition mediates the effect of the relationship of team locus-of-control composition and leadership structure on team financial performance in a decision-making context. Hypotheses were tested on 44 teams participating in an elaborate and lengthy international management simulation. As predicted, teams with high average internal locus-of-control scores performed better without leaders and with low locus-of-control heterogeneity. The opposite was found for teams with high average external locus-of-control scores. Contrary to expectations, teams with high locus-of-control heterogeneity did not benefit more from having leaders than teams with low heterogeneity. Information acquisition mediated relationships between locus-of-control composition and performance.</p>

            <p>Exploring how organizational antecedents affect potential and realized absorptive capacity, this study identifies differing effects for both components of absorptive capacity. Results indicate that organizational mechanisms associated with coordination capabilities (cross-functional interfaces, participation in decision making, and job rotation) primarily enhance a unit's potential absorptive capacity. Organizational mechanisms associated with socialization capabilities (connectedness and socialization tactics) primarily increase a unit's realized absorptive capacity. Our findings reveal why units may have difficulty managing levels of potential and realized absorptive capacity and vary in their ability to create value from their absorptive capacity.</p>
            <p>We develop a framework of service-unit behavior that begins with a unit's leader's service-focused behavior and progresses through intermediate links (service climate and customer-focused organizational citizenship behavior) to customer satisfaction and then unit sales. Data from a sample of 56 supermarket departments provide at least moderate support for our mediational hypotheses. We discuss findings with a particular focus on the relationship between internal organization functioning and external effectiveness in service settings. In addition, several issues related to testing for mediation using quantitative analysis are identified and discussed.</p>

            <p>We examined the extent to which organizations' reputations encompass different types of stakeholders' perceptions, which may have differential effects on economic outcomes. Specifically, we propose that reputation consists of two dimensions: (1) stakeholders' perceptions of an organization as able to produce quality goods and (2) organizations' prominence in the minds of stakeholders. We empirically examined the distinct antecedents and consequences of these two dimensions of reputation in the context of U.S. business schools. Results suggest that prominence, which derives from the choices of influential third parties vis-√†-vis an organization, contributes significantly to the price premium associated with having a favorable reputation.</p>

The guiding research question is how a biotech company is integrated into a pharmaceutical company seeking access to the biotech company's know-how, technologies, and innovative capabilities. I conclude that given the complexity and multifaceted nature of mergers and acquisitions, pharmaceutical companies need to apply a hybrid postacquisition integration approach with simultaneous short- and long-term motives/orientations and segmentation at a different pace across different value chain components.</p>
            <p>Treatment errors are a major problem in the health care industry. This study explored four dimensions of safety climate and the interactions among them as predictors of treatment errors. A total of 632 participants in 46 hospital units assessed their units' safety climate. Results demonstrated a curvilinear relationship between the levels of the perceived detailing of safety procedures and the number of treatment errors. Also, the perceived priority of safety moderated the curvilinear relationship between safety procedures and treatment errors as well as the relationship between the way employees interpreted their managers' safety practices and treatment errors.</p>
            <p>In this article, we respond to calls by previous researchers to clarify the function of decentralized institutions by analyzing the strategic motives of individual actors. We investigated an important type of decentralized institution, certified management standards, and theorized that firms use these institutions to reduce problems that might arise with exchange partners that lack information or fear opportunism. We tested this theory using the pattern of certification with the ISO 14001 management standard.</p>

            <p>Educational and national diversity are proposed to influence work teams' information use differently, with educational diversity mainly enhancing information use and national diversity invoking social categorization, thus hindering information use. As expected, increasing educational diversity positively influenced the range and depth of information use for all except the most diverse teams we studied, but negatively influenced information integration. In contrast to our expectations, national diversity had curvilinear relationships with the range, depth, and integration of information use. Both types of diversity provided information-processing benefits that outweighed the limitations associated with social categorization processes.</p>

            <p>We considered the role of strategic choice and institutional factors in influencing how managers have addressed workplace substance abuse. Substance abuse prevention program adoption was examined in a sample of 360 establishments. Normative pressure, reflected by changes in media discourse about substance abuse, was related to adoption of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) and drug-testing programs. Institutional factors were relevant for adopters of EAPs, but strategic choice factors were more significant for drug testing in the earliest of the three periods of adoption examined here.</p>
            <p>Achieving employee adherence to organizational rules and policies is critical for successful coordination and functioning within organizations. In this article, we explore the antecedents of such rule-following behavior and present two studies of employees that compare two strategies for achieving rule and policy adherence: (1) an extrinsically oriented command-and-control model and (2) an intrinsically oriented self-regulatory model. The findings of both studies suggest that the influence of the self-regulatory strategy exceeds that of the command-and-control approach. Overall, these studies highlight the potential value of fostering employee rule following via intrinsically oriented self-regulatory mechanisms and suggest strategies for implementing such mechanisms.</p>

            <p>This study examined how suggestion-based employee knowledge generated through a gainsharing productivity improvement program affected organizational performance. We propose that in addition to an organizational learning curve based on production experience, there is also a learning curve for cost reduction ideas implemented under gainsharing. Using four years of monthly data from one organization, we found that, after taking into account knowledge depreciation, the cumulative number of implemented employee suggestions significantly contributed to lower production costs. Implications for gainsharing practice and knowledge management theory are discussed.</p>
            <p>In this study, we examined the relationship between the demographic diversity and innovative climates of 248 organizational locations of a multinational company in 24 countries. Supporting a status characteristics perspective, multilevel analyses revealed that diversity in the more task-oriented demographic attributes of organizational tenure and functional background was negatively related to these locations' innovative climates in high-power-distance countries but positively related to the locations' innovative climate in low-power-distance countries. These interactive effects were not found for the more relations-oriented demographic attributes of age and gender.</p>
            <p>This study examines change initiated from the center of mature organizational fields. As such, it addresses the paradox of embedded agency--that is, the paradox of how actors enact changes to the context by which they, as actors, are shaped. The change examined is the introduction of a new organizational form. Combining network location theory and dialectical theory, we identify four dynamics that form a process model of elite institutional entrepreneurship.</p>

            <p>Investigating spillovers (potential costs and benefits to a firm that extend beyond an individual transaction), I integrate transaction cost theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm in an effort to better understand the efficient governance of knowledge. Contracts with detailed task descriptions were associated with transactions with the potential to generate new and reusable knowledge. The risk of a firm's technology spilling over to others and the risk of reputation-impairing spillovers were associated with suppliers using their own employees rather than subcontractors. Thus, results suggest that the creation and protection of knowledge are key factors in understanding governance decisions.</p>

            <p>Integrating creativity and social network theories, I explore the direct and interactive effects of relationship strength, network position, and external ties on individual creative contributions. Results from a study of research scientists suggest that weaker ties are generally beneficial for creativity, whereas stronger ties have neutral effects. I also found that centrality is more positively associated with creativity when individuals have few ties outside of their organization and that the combination of centrality and many outside ties is not optimal. I discuss the implications of these findings for creativity and social network research.</p>
            <p>To examine social interdependence theory dynamically, we develop a theory of structural adaptation based on "asymmetric adaptability." We suggest that it is more difficult for teams to shift from competitive to cooperative reward structures than from cooperative to competitive structures. We show that teams that switch from competitive to cooperative reward structures demonstrate "cutthroat cooperation." In their performance, marked by lower team decision accuracy and higher speed, they resemble competitive teams more than cooperative teams. Information sharing, also lower for cutthroat cooperation teams than for other cooperative teams, partially mediates the relationship between reward structure and accuracy.</p>
            <p>This study examines the effects of formal structure on the performance of new ventures in the emergent Internet sector during the years 1996-2001. Burns and Stalker (1961) argued that in dynamic economic sectors, firms with organic structures are more effective than those with more mechanistic structures. We suggest this proposition does not hold for new ventures in turbulent, emergent economic sectors. Building on Stinchombe's (1965) arguments concerning new ventures' liability of newness, we hypothesize that new ventures with higher founding team formalization, specialization, and administrative intensity outperform those with more organic organizational structures. Results support these hypotheses.</p>

In this study, we viewed turnover as a key predictor in determining unit-level performance. Specifically, a structural model was developed and tested that links managerial and employee turnover with performance through efficiency. We tested the model using a sample of 262 BURGER KING¬Æ restaurants. Results demonstrate that efficiency, measured as customer "wait time," mediates the relationships of both management and crew turnover to both sales and profit, and efficiency, measured as food waste, does not mediate the relationship of turnover to sales or profit.</p>

            <p>We examine the connection between the internal heterogeneity of stakeholder groups and the resource dependence dynamics characterizing their relationships with firms. Empirically, we test how this heterogeneity is related to environmental performance and document a positive relationship between community stakeholder pressures and environmental performance at the plant level. Our results suggest that varying stakeholder characteristics and the dependencies associated with them are related to varying levels of environmental performance. Further, managers recognize that their organizations' dependence on stakeholders is not uniform and take this dependence into account when shaping policies toward the natural environment.</p>

Drawing on 770 surveys from top management team members in these companies, objective stock market and accounting data, and an objective measure of environmental uncertainty, we found that organizational performance was associated with subsequent perceptions of CEO charisma but that perceptions of CEO charisma were not associated with subsequent organizational performance, even after we incorporated the potential moderating effect of environmental uncertainty.</p>
            <p>We analyze changes over time in the types of consulting firms offering total quality management services. When TQM was a booming management fashion, consultants tended to be generalists with weak links to the technical foundations of the practice; after the fashion went bust, TQM consulting was increasingly populated by specialists with quality control expertise. These results suggest that fashionable practices can return to their technical roots after the hype is over, reversing the usual institutional trajectory. They also help explain why fashion booms are so fragile and how management practices can be sustained once a boom is over.</p>

            <p>Through a six-year qualitative study of medical residents, we build theory about professional identity construction. We found that identity construction was triggered by work-identity integrity violations: an experienced mismatch between what physicians did and who they were. These violations were resolved through identity customization processes (enriching, patching, or splinting), which were part of interrelated identity and work learning cycles. Implications of our findings (e.g., for member identification) for both theory and practice are discussed.</p>

            <p>Large, established firms acquiring small, technology-based firms must manage them so as to both exploit their capabilities and technologies in a coordinated way and foster their exploration capacity by preserving their autonomy. We suggest that acquirers can resolve this coordination-autonomy dilemma by recognizing that the effect of structural form on innovation outcomes depends on the developmental stage of acquired firms' innovation trajectories. Structural integration decreases the likelihood of introducing new products for firms that have not launched products before being acquired and for all firms immediately after acquisition, but these effects disappear as innovation trajectories evolve.</p>

            <p>Using the discourse of high tech in Israel around the millennium as a case study, I explore institutionalization as translation. Whereas the meanings attached to high tech were derived from broad cultural frameworks, they were reconstructed in the context of high tech. Differences in construction were manifested at two times and at two levels: before the high-tech economic bubble and after it, and at the societal and organizational field levels. Thus, institutionalization involves the translation of generic rational myths into specific ones, which change over time in relation to material fluctuations and depend on the dynamics of local institutional spheres.</p>

            <p>Drawing on the compatibility principle in attitude theory, we propose that overall job attitude (job satisfaction and organizational commitment) provides increasingly powerful prediction of more integrative behavioral criteria (focal performance, contextual performance, lateness, absence, and turnover combined). The principle was sustained by a combination of meta-analysis and structural equations showing better fit of unified versus diversified models of meta-analytic correlations between those criteria. Overall job attitude strongly predicted a higher-order behavioral construct, defined as desirable contributions made to one's work role (r = .59). Time-lagged data also supported this unified, attitude-engagement model.</p>
            <p>Although the effects of transformational leadership on task performance and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) are well-documented, the mechanisms that explain those effects remain unclear. We propose that transformational leadership is associated with the way followers view their jobs, in terms of Hackman and Oldham's (1976) core job characteristics. Results of our study support a structural model whereby indirect effects supplement the direct effects of transformational leadership on task performance and OCB through the mechanisms of job characteristics, intrinsic motivation, and goal commitment. Additional analyses revealed that transformational leadership relationships were significantly stronger for followers who perceived high-quality leader-member exchange.</p>

            <p>Local density (the number of firms vying for similar resources in a local environment) has been overlooked in explaining foreign subsidiary performance. This study drew upon the concepts of liability of foreignness and density dependence to examine how local density within a host country affected performance--directly and indirectly--through effects on market experience and strategic conformity. We found that local density was negatively related to foreign subsidiary performance and that market experience was less beneficial in high-density environments. Strategic conformity enhanced performance in low-density environments but adversely affected performance in high-density environments.</p>

            <p>We draw upon theories of organizational learning to examine acquisition likelihood in a sample of banking industry acquisitions from 1988 through 2001. Although research on organizational learning suggests that routines arising both from experience and from performance feedback guide organizational learning, the combined effect of these two sources of learning has rarely been examined. Findings are consistent with our theoretical predictions: (1) prior acquisition experience, (2) recent acquisition performance, and (3) the interaction between acquisition experience and recent acquisition performance are all positively related to the likelihood of subsequent acquisition.</p>

            <p>We examined how proportions of individuals in standard and nonstandard work arrangements affected work group members' relationships with supervisors, social relations with coworkers, willingness to assist others, and intentions to leave their organization. Supporting Blalock's theory of majority-minority group relations, higher proportions of nonstandard workers were associated with less favorable attitudes toward supervisors and peers, increased turnover intentions, and decreased work-related helping behaviors. The consequences of heterogeneity in employment arrangements were contingent on (1) workers' locations in their firm's mobility system, (2) type of nonstandard arrangements, and (3) the amount and type of contact between standard and nonstandard workers.</p>

            <p>We hypothesized that organizational culture moderates the relationship between justice perceptions and leader-member exchange (LMX). In a sample of 516 teachers from 30 high schools in Turkey, we found that one dimension of culture from the Organizational Culture Profile, respect for people, strengthened the relationship between interactional justice and LMX, and another dimension, team orientation, weakened that relationship. Furthermore, aggressiveness strengthened, whereas team orientation weakened, the relationship between distributive justice and LMX. Finally, we found that in team-oriented schools, LMX was higher.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a longitudinal study of organizational responses to environmental changes that induce members to question aspects of their organization's identity. Our findings highlight the role of organizational culture as a source of cues supporting "sensemaking" action carried out by leaders as they reevaluate their conceptualization of their organization, and as a platform for "sensegiving" actions aimed at affecting internal perceptions. Building on evidence from our research, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding how the interplay of construed images and organizational culture shapes changes in institutional claims and shared understandings about the identity of an organization.</p>

            <p>Drawing on social identity theory and status-based perspectives, we describe how in-group/out-group dynamics affect performance differences and earnings inequalities between members of higher-status majorities (whites, males) and lower-status minorities (people of color, women). Among sales employees on 437 teams in 46 units of a large company, team demographic composition and unit management composition moderated the relationship between individual demographic attributes and pay. Ethnicity-based earnings inequalities were smaller in teams with proportionately more people of color, and gender- and ethnicity-based inequalities were smaller in units with proportionately more women and people of color as managers. Partial mediation by performance was found.</p>

            <p>We contrast the conventional view that CEO stock options aid corporate governance by reducing moral hazard with the proposal that CEO stock options may subvert sound corporate governance. Views were tested in 65 matched pairs of public U.S. firms that either had or had not been discovered misreporting financial results. Our results support both the traditional perspective and our unprincipled agent view: in our sample, large CEO stock option grants were sometimes associated with a lower incidence of fraudulent reporting and sometimes with a greater incidence, depending upon whether CEO duality was present and whether directors also held stock options.</p>

            <p>Integrating and extending literature on international management and team effectiveness, we examined how macro context in multinational organizations (MNCs) influences work team learning and how team learning influences task performance and interpersonal relations. We examined these influences in a multimethod study of 115 teams in 20 subsidiaries of five MNCs. Controlling for micro contextual features, including team type, training, feedback, and autonomy, we found that organizational contexts emphasizing global integration reduced team learning, but those emphasizing responsiveness and knowledge management increased team learning. Team learning in turn positively influenced both task performance and the quality of interpersonal relations.</p>

            <p>Since the publication of Williamson's Markets and Hierarchies, many empirical articles have investigated the tenets of transaction cost theory. Using meta-analytic techniques, we quantitatively synthesized and evaluated transaction cost--based empirical research on organizational boundary (make, buy, or ally) decisions. We found strong support for the theory for both make versus buy and ally versus buy decisions. However, we did not find evidence that asset specificity had stronger predictive power than uncertainty. Hierarchical and relational governance appropriately aligned with transaction dimensions both led to enhanced performance. On the basis of our meta-analysis, we provide directions for future research.</p>

            <p>In this study, we developed and tested a theory of how human resource practices affect the organizational social climate conditions that facilitate knowledge exchange and combination and resultant firm performance. A field study of 136 technology companies showed that commitment-based human resource practices were positively related to the organizational social climates of trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language. In turn, these measures of a firm's social climate were related to the firm's capability to exchange and combine knowledge, a relationship that predicted firm revenue from new products and services and firm sales growth.</p>
            <p>An experience-sampling study investigating the dynamic process through which personal traits and affective and attitudinal states experienced at work influence intraindividual patterns of organizational citizenship behavior over time generally supported hypotheses. First, at the intraindividual level, experience-sampled positive affect and job satisfaction predicted experience-sampled reports of organizational citizenship behaviors over time. Second, cross-level interaction between agreeableness and positive affect predicted organizational citizenship behavior. Compared to less agreeable employees, agreeable employees reported both engaging more often in organizational citizenship behavior and more consistent patterns of such behavior; their engagement in these behaviors was less dependent on their momentary positive affect.</p>

            <p>In an effort to extend theory and research on the effects of acute stress in teams, I examined the mediational role of mental models and transactive memory in the relationship between acute stress and team performance, using information-processing theory as an explanatory framework. Results for 97 teams working on a command-and-control simulation indicated that acute stress negatively affected mental models and transactive memory, which helped to explain why teams performed more poorly under acute stress.</p>
            <p>What implications does a firm's specialization have for the performance the firm achieves by spanning structural holes between its partners? By analyzing networks within the Canadian investment banking industry, I found that, in networks rich in structural holes, both specialists and generalists performed better than banks of moderate specialization levels, and that generalist banks, in turn, performed better than specialists.</p>

            <p>We advance a time-based theory of how team attributes, in terms of formal plans and knowledge, influence episodic transition and interpersonal processes and their relationships with team performance. Data were collected from 29 student teams that competed in a business simulation over four episodes (i.e., performance periods). We found mixed support for the notion that episodic processes partially mediate the relationships between team attributes and performance. Some unexpected yet informative interactive relationships were found.</p>
            <p>How do members' and leaders' social network structures help or hinder team effectiveness? A meta-analysis of 37 studies of teams in natural contexts suggests that teams with densely configured interpersonal ties attain their goals better and are more committed to staying together; that is, team task performance and viability are both higher. Further, teams with leaders who are central in the teams' intragroup networks and teams that are central in their intergroup network tend to perform better. Time sequencing, member familiarity, and tie content moderate structure-performance connections. Results suggest stronger incorporation of social network concepts into theories about team effectiveness.</p>
            <p>We used the results from Financial World's widely publicized certification contest, CEO of the Year, to investigate the impact of such contests on firm performance and executive compensation. A certification contest ranks actors on performance criteria that key stakeholders accept as credible and legitimate. We found that certified CEOs received higher compensation than noncertified CEOs when performance was high but lower remuneration when performance was poor. Although certifications appear to generate positive abnormal returns when they are first announced, the longer-term impact of CEO certifications appears to be negative.</p>

            <p>Integrating multilevel theory and the attraction-selection-attrition model, we conceptualized personality homogeneity as human capital emergence containing both composition (aggregate mean) and compilation (aggregate standard deviation) components. Sampling service employees, jobs, and organizations, we analyzed relationships across levels using random coefficient modeling. Individual-, job-, and organization-level mean personality were related to job satisfaction and performance. Job- and organization-level variances were frequently negatively related to satisfaction and performance, and job- and organization-level means and variances sometimes interacted. Our results support a multilevel interpretation of the ASA model and suggest human capital manifests multiple structures having different functional consequences across levels.</p>
            <p>We theorize that in geographically dispersed teams, members' geographic locations are likely to activate "faultlines" (hypothetical dividing lines that split a group into subgroups) that impair team functioning. In a study of 45 teams comprised of graduate students from 14 schools in ten countries, we found that geographic faultlines heightened conflict and reduced trust. These faultlines were stronger when a team was divided into two equally sized subgroups of colocated members and when these subgroups were homogeneous in nationality.</p>
            <p>Exploration and exploitation have emerged as the twin concepts underpinning organizational adaptation research, yet some central issues related to them remain ambiguous. We address four related questions here: What do exploration and exploitation mean? Are they two ends of a continuum or orthogonal to each other? How should organizations achieve balance between exploration and exploitation--via ambidexterity or punctuated equilibrium? Finally, must all organizations strive for a balance, or is specialization in exploitation or exploration sometimes sufficient for long-run success? We summarize the contributions of the work in this special research forum and highlight important directions for future research.</p>
            <p>In his classic article on exploration and exploitation, March (1991) presented an agent-based model simulating learning within an organization. His model includes mutual learning between individuals and an organizational code. We extend March's model by (1) allowing for direct interpersonal learning, (2) locating individuals in a space, which makes the distinction between local and distant search relevant, and (3) recognizing that knowledge has a tacit dimension that cannot be transmitted through codification. We also consider the implications of personnel turnover for learning over time. Our results qualify and extend March's (1991) conclusions.</p>

            <p>This study focuses on effects of knowledge and experience on both mean and variance measures of individual and team innovations. We propose that multiple knowledge domains produce novel combinations that increase the variance of product performance and that extensive experience produces outputs with high average performance. We analyzed innovations in the comic book industry, finding that innovations with extreme success and failure were affected by factors similar to those affecting high-performing innovations. Multimember teams and teams with experience working together produced innovations with greater variation in value, but individuals were able to combine knowledge diversity more effectively than teams.</p>
            <p>This paper's argument is that founding team composition--in particular, members' prior company affiliations--shapes new firm behaviors. Firms with founding teams whose members have worked at the same company engage in exploitation because they have shared understandings and can act quickly. Conversely, founding teams whose members have worked at many different companies have unique ideas and contacts that encourage exploration. In addition, firms whose founding teams have both common and diverse prior company affiliations have advantages that allow them to grow. The results suggest team composition is an important antecedent of exploitative and explorative behavior and firm ambidexterity.</p>
            <p>Informal and formal mechanisms affect choices between exploitation and exploration in team design. We argue that the status differentiation of team members and differences in organizational structure limit exploration in the form of introducing newcomers to teams and creating new combinations of team members. High- and low-status team members and one- and three-layer organizational structures were expected to be positively related to exploration, and middle-status team members and two-layer structures were expected to be negatively related to it. We used data on 6,446 motion pictures produced by the Hollywood film industry in the period 1929-58 to test our hypotheses.</p>

            <p>An enduring belief is that unleashing low-level members of an organization to explore extensively will broaden the exploration conducted by the entire organization. Using an agent-based simulation model, we show that in multilevel organizations, increased exploration at lower levels can backfire, reducing overall exploration and diminishing performance in environments that require broad search. This result arises when interdependencies cut across the domains of low-level managers. With no cross-departmental interdependencies, more extensive low-level exploration can improve firm performance. Our findings show that careful attention to information processing in multilevel organizations can shed light on whether, and when, decentralization encourages innovation.</p>

            <p>Do firms balance exploration and exploitation in their alliance formation decisions and, if so, why and how? We argue that absorptive capacity and organizational inertia impose conflicting pressures for exploration and exploitation with respect to the value chain function of alliances, the attributes of partners, and partners' network positions. Although path dependencies reinforce either exploration or exploitation within each of these domains, we find that firms balance their tendencies to explore and exploit over time and across domains.</p>

            <p>Investment in entrepreneurial ventures has gained recent popularity as a means for established firms to learn about new technologies and markets. However, the link between such corporate venture capital (CVC) investments and innovation outcomes has not been examined in detail. Using panel data from corporate investors in telecommunications equipment manufacturing, we investigated the conditions under which CVC investments affect knowledge creation for corporate investors. We found that, when investor involvement is low, number of CVC investments has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation performance. However, when investor involvement is high, the relationship reverses, and an increase in investments boosts innovation.</p>
            <p>This article develops and tests a multilevel theory of the intragroup dynamics and performance outcomes associated with diversity in levels of member expertise--"expertness diversity"--in task-oriented teams. Drawing from theories of power and dependence, we argue that in groups where members differ in their perceived expertness, members will be more committed to and more likely to help those seen as more expert, a dynamic that frustrates intragroup learning and compromises group performance. These hypotheses were strongly supported in a multiperiod, multilevel analysis of social relations and performance outcomes in a sample of student research teams.</p>

            <p>We examine how uncertainty moderates the trust-performance relationship in alliances, building on the distinction between behavioral uncertainty, which relates to anticipating and understanding partners' actions, and externally caused environmental uncertainty. We argue that trust matters more to performance under behavioral uncertainty and less under environmental uncertainty. In data from 126 international alliances, the positive relationship between trust and performance is stronger under high behavioral uncertainty and weaker under high environmental uncertainty. We conclude that partners should concentrate on developing interorganizational trust where potential improvement in alliance performance justifies this effort, which in turn depends on the type of uncertainty faced.</p>

            <p>Changes in employment relationships have diminished the degree to which internal labor markets shape careers. Using comparative field studies, we examine how contract workers try to achieve career progression without the benefit of organizational guidance. Specifically, we examine how contract workers manage the career progression paradox: the problem of finding a job without prior experience. "Stretchwork" bridging from proven competencies to new ones helps reconcile this paradox. We identify four tactics used to acquire stretchwork, explore the conditions affecting the success of those tactics, and offer theoretical implications for career progression in external labor markets.</p>
            <p>We address independent and joint effects of contractual hazards and technological capabilities on governance, arguing that strong technological capabilities improve a firm's ability to govern transactions, making outsourcing feasible despite certain contractual hazards. Examining a random sample of 405 service contracts from a single information technology firm, we found that contractual hazards encouraged internalizing transactions. Weak technological capabilities increased the likelihood of subcontracting, but strong technological capabilities had no independent effect. The latter had impact only in the presence of certain contractual hazards. These results illuminate why firms facing similar levels of contracting hazards organize their transactions differently.</p>

            <p>Agency theory suggests that the interests of opportunistic, self-interested agents conflict with those of principals. Stewardship theory suggests instead that executives' interests are aligned with company interests and that executives are thus more intrinsically motivated than agency theory implies. This study develops hypotheses regarding the psychological and situational factors that affect the applicability of each theory to executive compensation. I tested hypotheses using a unique data set of 1,238 executives from 528 private companies. Results suggest significant differences between founder-stewards and nonfounder agents that diminish with company growth, and significant effects of equity ownership and outside rounds of financing.</p>

            <p>How do individual actors institute changes in established ways of working? Longitudinal research is the basis for our theoretical model showing how actors legitimize new practices by accomplishing three interdependent, recursive, situated "microprocesses": (1) cultivating opportunities for change, (2) fitting a new role into prevailing systems, and (3) proving the value of the new role. These microprocesses are demarcated by an accumulating series of small wins that consolidate gains while facilitating continuing change efforts. Most accounts of institutional change focus on embeddedness as a constraint, yet our study shows how embeddedness can provide the foundation and opportunity for change.</p>

            <p>Although interest in the workplace trends of downsizing and high-involvement work practices continues to grow, research examining the intersection between them has been limited. In this study, we examine (1) how layoffs moderate the relationship between high-involvement work practices and productivity, and (2) how continued investments in these work practices throughout layoff periods maintain workforce productivity. Findings indicate a negative relationship between high-involvement work practices and productivity in workplaces with higher layoff rates. However, workplaces that continue investments in high-involvement work practices are able to avoid productivity losses, as compared to workplaces that discontinue such investments.</p>

            <p>Emotional ambivalence, or the simultaneous experience of positive and negative emotions, is an underexplored emotional state in organizations. The results from two laboratory experiments demonstrate that individuals experiencing emotional ambivalence are better at recognizing unusual relationships between concepts, therefore showing an ability believed to be important to organizational creativity. Informational theories of emotion suggest that individuals interpret emotional ambivalence, which is perceived to be an unusual emotional experience, as signaling they are in an unusual environment, which in turn increases sensitivity to unusual associations. These results yield important implications regarding how to influence creative performance at work.</p>
            <p>Through two qualitative studies, we examine how members of a particularly demanding occupation conduct identity work to negotiate an optimal balance between personal and social identities. Findings are based on open-ended survey responses from and in-depth interviews with Episcopal priests. We first explore the situational and vocational demands placed on those in challenging occupations, along with the identity tensions that often result from those demands. We then specify and classify several identity work tactics that ameliorate these demands and tensions by differentiating or integrating personal and social identities. To synthesize findings, we develop a theoretical model of identity work.</p>

            <p>Comparing the effectiveness of contractual and relational governance in constraining opportunism under conditions of volatility and ambiguity, we hypothesize that relational contracts will be robust to volatility but not to ambiguity, whereas formal contracts will be robust to ambiguity but not to volatility. Data from 125 interorganizational relationships involving R&amp;D for new-product development support these hypotheses. Our findings suggest that formal and relational contracts each have advantages and disadvantages in specific situations and are not simply substitutes. Our results challenge the view that relational contracts are resistant to opportunism. A revised comparative governance schema is theorized for future research.</p>
            <p>Using a qualitative design, we develop a model of discrimination lawsuit resolution identifying type of discrimination, firms' verbal and behavioral responses, and stakeholder mobilization as key. Data from media accounts of lawsuits reveal four paths to resolution, distinguishable largely by the type of discrimination they represent. Findings also highlight aspects of race discrimination and sexual harassment that invite different organizational responses than other forms of discrimination. In addition, analysis of the response paths suggests that external stakeholders with and without formal authority critically influence firms' responses. We discuss findings in the context of organizational responses to threat, and institutional theory.</p>

            <p>Using event history analysis, we found that CEOs and CFOs of firms filing a material financial restatement were more than twice as likely to exit their firms as their counterparts in a matched sample. Directors and audit committee members were approximately 70 percent more likely to exit in restatement firms. The magnitude, ubiquity, and temporal proximity of executive and director turnover following a restatement indicate that such events pose a serious threat to organizational legitimacy, independent of firm performance. Restatements therefore provide an important and unique context for studying the accountability of strategic leaders for organizational crises.</p>

            <p>To further knowledge about the bases of internationalization, we examined the importance of two firm resources: human capital, and relational capital derived from relations with corporate clients and foreign governments. The results show that human and relational capital generally had a positive effect on internationalization; however, corporate client relational capital was only positive teamed with strong human capital. Additionally, human capital positively moderated the relationship between internationalization and firm performance, but neither form of relational capital moderated that relationship. Although corporate client relational capital had a strong, positive effect on firm performance, foreign government relational capital had a negative effect on performance.</p>

            <p>I present and test a model of issue crafting, in which individuals shape the meaning of social issues by intentionally using language in public that portrays those issues in ways that differ from the individuals' private understandings of the issues. Using statements collected with an experimental design, I found that the public language individuals used was more economic and less normative than were their private understandings. Issue crafting varies with organizational values and power relationships. It calls attention to the use of language for seeking influence and extends theories of influence, including sensegiving, issue selling, and influence tactics.</p>

Using data from a sample of contemporary German corporations, we find support for our predictions that firms (1) use specific framing language that fits better with their divergent stakeholder preferences, (2) use language that decouples espousal and actual implementation of strategic change, and (3) realize positive market responses to institutionally appropriate frames of change.</p>

The study contributes to research on influence tactics and LMX by pointing out how their joint effects may impact member behaviors toward a work group.</p>

            <p>This paper develops and tests a theory of the performance determinants of a firm's nonmarket strategy in shaping public policy outcomes. Building on the concept of political market attractiveness, we argue that nonmarket performance is influenced by both the characteristics of a firm's regulatory and political environment, especially rivalry among interest groups or politicians, and by internal capabilities that enable a firm to mitigate political transaction costs. Using data on regulatory filings for rate increases made by U.S. electric utilities over a 13-year period, we find empirical support for our approach.</p>

            <p>Primitive emotional contagion has been proposed to explain why "service with a smile" predicts encounter satisfaction. We provide a comprehensive test of this mechanism by examining mimicry and mood as mediators in service encounters, contrasting such mediation with a direct path through perceived service quality. Independent coders recorded the strength of employees' and customers' smiles at three points in time during real service encounters, and 173 customers completed postencounter surveys. Mimicry effects were supported; however, only service quality appraisals, and not customers' affect, fully mediated the relationship of employee smiling and encounter satisfaction.</p>
            <p>We surveyed management teams in 102 hotel properties in the United States to examine the intervening roles of knowledge sharing and team efficacy in the relationship between empowering leadership and team performance. Team performance was measured through a time-lagged market-based source. Results showed that empowering leadership was positively related to both knowledge sharing and team efficacy, which, in turn, were both positively related to performance.</p>
            <p>We examined the relationship between group boundary spanners' work group identification and effective (i.e., harmonious and productive) intergroup relations in 53 work groups in five health care organizations. The data suggest this relationship was moderated by boundary spanners' levels of organizational identification, thus supporting a dual identity model. Limited support was found for the moderating effect of intergroup contact. Finally, if boundary spanners displayed frequent intergroup contact and identified highly with their organization, group identification was most strongly related to effective intergroup relations.</p>
            <p>We study the resolution of conflicts of interest that arise when actors in professional firms represent separate parties with competing interests, using models of power and reputation to predict the resolution of such conflicts. We tested models on an initial sample of over 8,000 security analysts' ratings of corporate equity securities. Results show that analysts rate their clients' securities more favorably than other analysts rating the same securities. This positive bias is moderated by the reputation of the analyst and his or her department. Implications and extensions for organizational theory, multiservice professional firms, and security market regulation are discussed.</p>

            <p>Under what conditions will women raise and promote gender-equity issues in their work organizations? We used structural equation modeling to analyze responses from a sample of over a thousand female managers to address this question. The results suggest that the perceived favorability of the organizational context fosters a willingness to sell gender-equity issues in organizations. The contextual factors that influenced willingness to sell were perceptions of a high degree of organizational support and of a warm and trusting relationship with critical decision makers, which enhanced the perceived probability of selling success and diminished the perceived image risk in selling. Organizational norms for issue selling also increased willingness to sell gender-equity issues by deflating perceived image risk. Individual differences did not predict willingness to sell gender-equity issues. We address the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.</p>
            <p>The study reported here uses learning theory to examine how performance feedback affects the probability of risky organizational changes that are consequential to an organization's performance. The theory predicts how decision makers interpret organizational performance by comparing it with historical and social aspiration levels. Empirical analysis of the consequences of performance short-falls on the probability of strategic change in the radio broadcasting industry shows clear sensitivity to social and historical aspiration levels. It also shows that changes seen or done by the station predict future change, suggesting that the recent experiences of organizations cause differences in capabilities and perceived opportunities, leading to differences in organizational inertia.</p>

            <p>Using grounded theory, we examined a "defender" and a "prospector" bank's strategic adaptation to the Community Redevelopment Act across seven years during which they were under increasing regulatory pressure to comply. The interplay of institutional, organizational, and strategic issue context patterns led the defender to an aborted adaptation and the prospector to a reorientation. Each demonstrated a different form of resistance to demands for compliance to the act: identity resistance (change inconsistent with organizational identity) and virtuous resistance (change not needed since already part of the bank's identity). We observed both incremental and punctuated equilibrium change modes, though only incremental change was sustained. Institutional isomorphism and organizational performance exerted counterintuitive pressures for initiating and sustaining change. Drawing on our results, we develop propositions on organizations' adaptations to change.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the consequences of symbolic action in corporate governance. Specifically, we examine (1) whether the stock market reacts favorably to specific governance mechanisms that convey the alignment of CEO and shareholder interests, such as the adoption of long-term incentive plans (LTIPs), even if such plans are not actually implemented, (2) whether providing agency-related explanations for LTIPs affects the stock market response, and (3) whether the symbolic adoption of LTIPs deters other governance reforms that would reduce CEOs' control over their boards. Analysis of data from over 400 corporations over a ten-year period suggests that symbolic corporate actions can engender significant positive stockholder reactions and deter other, more substantive governance reforms, thus perpetuating power imbalances in organizations. We discuss implications for institutional and agency-based perspectives on organizations.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we examine the underlying dynamics of the differences between blacks' and whites' responses to social accounts-explanations or excuses for negative actions and events. Across four studies we found that when black respondents observed unjust behaviors toward a hypothetical black victim, social accounts had a weak impact on perceptions of injustice, confirming the presence of what we call the "persistent injustice effect." We also found that social accounts have a weaker impact on perceptions of injustice than on disapproval of the harm-doer and posit that the persistent injustice effect results from a combination of in-group identification with the victim and the respondent's personal experiences with injustice. These two factors, we theorize, combine to create greater empathy for the victim.</p>
            <p>Drawing from self-categorization theory, we tested hypotheses on the effects of an organization's demographic composition and cultural emphasis on work processes and outcomes. Using an organizational simulation, we found that the extent to which an organization emphasized individualistic or collectivistic values interacted with demographic composition to influence social interaction, conflict, productivity, and perceptions of creativity among 258 MBA students. Our findings suggest that the purported benefits of demographic diversity are more likely to emerge in organizations that, through their culture, make organizational membership salient and encourage people to categorize one another as having the organization's interests in common, rather than those that emphasize individualism and distinctiveness among members.</p>
            <p>This study examines why firms choose different governance structures across their alliances. We focus on the coordination costs in alliances that arise from interdependence of tasks across organizational boundaries and the related complexity of ongoing activities to be completed jointly or individually. We use a typology of alliance governance structures that differentiates structures by the magnitude of hierarchical controls to test hypotheses predicting alternative contractual choices. We use empirical data on alliance announcements in three worldwide industries over a 20-year period to assess which factors explain the choice of alliance types. The findings suggest that the magnitude of hierarchical controls in contractual relationships such as alliances is influenced by the anticipated coordination costs and by expected appropriation concerns.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this study was to investigate when director interlocks affect corporate behavior, and how much influence they exert, by studying the conditions under which their influence varies. Existing theory supports the view that interlocks provide information, which affects firms' adoption of strategies and structures. If interlocks provide information, their influence should diminish to the extent that alternate sources of information are available. We measured the effect of alternate sources of information on the relationship between interlocks and corporate acquisitions. Results show that most alternate sources (e.g., CEO membership in the Business Roundtable) reduce the impact of the interlock, but one source (business press coverage) increases it. Also, information from similar interlock partners is more influential than information from dissimilar interlock partners. Our findings suggest a theory of interorganizational information: the substitutability and complementarity of multiple information sources affect their influence. The implications of our study for interlock and information theories are discussed.</p>
            <p>The study reported here uses a population ecology approach to examine whether bureaucratic rules breed more rules. Hypotheses about the birth rate of bureaucratic rules are derived and tested with time series data on rule production in a large U.S. research university. Results show that the rate of rule production declines with the number of rules in a rule population over time. The results support organizational learning theories: by expanding the number of rules, organizations increasingly respond to environmental challenges in a programmed way, reducing organizational experiences with new situations, inhibiting organizational learning, and thereby eliminating a main impetus for making more rules. Radical bureaucratization theories, however, are not supported.</p>

            <p>Using data on 143 hospital organizations, this article examines the antecedents and effects of two forms of organizational legitimacy (managerial and technical) over a 46-year period. Results show that both the managerial and technical forms provide notable improvements in organizational survival chances but that the strength of each effect varies over time depending on the nature of the institutional environment. Variation also appears in the antecedents of legitimacy - for example, the ability of a hospital to secure approval for its managerial practices depends on the correspondence between its mission and the logic of the surrounding institutional environment. The results suggest that a multidimensional model can reveal nuances of organizational legitimacy that are missed by more unitary conceptions.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the impact of state-level prohibitions on the founding and mortality rates of breweries in prohibition-free states. Our results suggest that particularistic institutional action such as nonuniform government regulation creates externalities of two kinds. First, it creates resource flow opportunities for organizations that are not directly affected by such action. Second, it imposes indirect coercive pressures by influencing cultural norms in the environment of organizations that are not directly affected by the regulations. The overall direction and strength of these effects vary with the centrality of organizations in terms of their location, the time elapsed since an environmental change, and organizational age. We discuss the implications of our findings for organization theory, particularly the relationship between social movements and institutional action, the effects of institutional action on industry structure, and the linkage between environmental change, organizational age, and organizational mortality.</p>

            <p>This study examines how occupational mandates-the socially conferred right to perform a given set of tasks-are negotiated by nascent occupations. Because researchers typically examine occupational formation long after it has begun, they neglect activities that occur prior to the acquisition of key institutional supports. The commodification of work is one such activity. Work becomes a commodity when audiences deem a formerly unpaid activity worthy of remuneration. This study draws on ethnographic data to examine the strategic patterns of situated activity and interaction used by one fledgling occupation, emergency medical services, to convince key audiences that their work is indeed worthy of compensation. Strategies used to construct and communicate in situ impressions of expertise, consistency, fungibility, and contractual relations are examined. The results of the study shed light on the interactional foundation of institutionalization.</p>

            <p>We examine the extent to which executives' boundary spanning relations inside and outside their industry affect organizational strategy and performance. We posit that the informational and social influences of external ties will be reflected in the degree to which the organization's strategy conforms to or deviates from the central tendencies of its industry and that the alignment of executives' external ties with the firm's strategy will be beneficial to firm performance. Using a multiyear sample of firms in the branded foods and computer industries, we find that executives' intraindustry ties are related to strategic conformity, that extraindustry ties are associated with the adoption of deviant strategies, and that alignment of executives' external ties with the informational requirements of the firm's strategy enhances organizational performance. Our results also show that a unique or differentiated strategy is not universally advantageous and that the benefits accruing from strategic conformity are especially strong in the more uncertain computer industry.</p>

            <p>Drawing on archival and textual materials, this paper challenges conventional views of scientific management by exploring its aesthetic implications through an analysis of the inspiration that the European modernist architects of the 1890-1930 period drew from the ideology and techniques associated with this organizational model. The historical and institutional conditions that surrounded such a revolutionary reinterpretation of scientific management are compared across countries. The common grounding of scientific management and modernist architecture in engineering is proposed as the key influence that shaped the professional reconstruction of the organizational field of architecture and the subsequent diffusion of modernist design. The implications for organizational studies are discussed in the context of the prevailing underestimation of scientific management's qualities and impact on society.</p>

            <p>We blend network and organizational memory perspectives in a model of technology brokering that explains how an organization develops innovative products. The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archived data gathered during an ethnography of IDEO, a product design firm. This firm exploits its network position, working for clients in at least 40 industries, to gain knowledge of existing technological solutions in various industries. It acts as a technology broker by introducing these solutions where they are not known and, in the process, creates new products that are original combinations of existing knowledge from disparate industries. Designers exploit their access to a broad range of technological solutions with organizational routines for acquiring and storing this knowledge in the organization's memory and, by making analogies between current design problems and the past solutions they have seen, retrieving that knowledge to generate new solutions to design problems in other industries. We discuss the implications of this research for understanding the individual and organizational processes and norms underlying technology and knowledge transfer more generally.</p>

            <p>The model developed here explains why some firms survive while other firms with equal economic performance do not. We argue that organizational survival is not strictly a function of economic performance but also depends on a firm's own threshold of performance. We apply this threshold model to the study of new venture survival, in which the threshold is determined by the entrepreneur's human capital characteristics, such as alternative employment opportunities, psychic income from entrepreneurship, and cost of switching to other occupations. Using a sample of 1,547 entrepreneurs of new businesses in the U.S., we find strong support for the model. The findings suggest that firms with low thresholds may choose to continue or survive despite comparatively low performance.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we examine how conflicting ideologies affect organizational practice. We theorize that the basic relationship between ideology and organization is moderated by social pressures and economic incentives that result from differences between the organization and its environment on issues of ideology. Using data from Israeli kibbutzim for 1951-1965, we examine how the ideology of a set of socialist organizations affects the practices they employ and how the influence of socialist ideology is moderated by an environment that is governed by capitalism. We assess the change in the extent to which kibbutzim employed hired labor, a practice that is incompatible with kibbutzim socialist-Zionist ideology. We find that ideological organizing principles are affected by resource dependence pressures, particularly from banks, and economic incentives for organizations to change their form. These external influences combined with internal influences, such as kibbutz size, age, and industrialization, to account for kibbutzim's transition to hired labor. The results indicate how interaction with the environment can lead to the forfeiture of ideological organizing principles.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a model that incorporates the behavior of chief executive officers (CEOs) into an explanation of how boards of directors affect organizational outcomes. Hypotheses are tested with archival data on corporate strategy, CEO compensation, board structure, and demographics, together with data from an original survey of both CEOs and outside directors from 221 large-and medium-sized U.S. corporations. The findings indicate that (1) changes in board structure that increase the board's independence from management are associated with higher levels of CEO ingratiation and persuasion behavior toward board members, and (2) such influence behaviors, in turn, serve to offset the effect of increased structural board independence on corporate strategy and CEO compensation policy. Implications for theory and research on CEO-board power and effectiveness and the larger literature on power and influence are discussed.</p>
            <p>The study reported here uses the recent rapid growth in labor demand in an emerging economy to isolate the organizational forces determining the representation of women in high-skill jobs from labor supply factors. We test key predictions drawn from three theoretical perspectives: according to market incentive theories, firms are motivated to use human resources, including high-skill women, optimally; according to cultural theories, core national values can affect organizational gatekeepers' practices, while social psychological studies suggest that employees' preference for social homophily can make discriminatory behavior efficient. Analysis of original survey data on 114 multinational firms headquartered in the U.S. and Japan and 40 domestic companies operating in Thailand shows ambiguous market incentives to firms and no impact of national values on the employment of women. The results point to male employees' preferences as the basis of gender inequality as an organizational practice.</p>

            <p>This research examines how a supplier's relationships with other organizations in its environment influence the occurrence and timing of its international expansion. The paper describes how constraints on information and market attractiveness influence the establishment by a supplier of a first plant in a foreign location. We develop a model that captures these two constraints through the prevalence and timing of prior expansion by current and potential buyers, by rival suppliers, and by non-competing suppliers. An analysis of expansion patterns among 547 Japanese automotive component suppliers into the United States and Canada between 1978 and 1990 shows that the likelihood of supplier expansion increases at a decreasing rate as the number of its current buyers that have expanded increases. International expansion of competitors leads to an initial increase and a subsequent decrease in the supplier expansion rate. A supplier is more likely to expand within a short period after the first entry by a current buyer or by a potential buyer and within an extended period after the first entry by a non-competing supplier. Organizational size and scope and equity control by transplanted buyers have a modest positive effect on suppliers' international expansion.</p>

            <p>This article induces a model of the evolving rhetoric and reality of total quality management (TQM) in five organizations to show how institutional forces can distort the technical reality of TQM. Using interviews, organizational documents, and observation, I follow the social construction of TQM in these organizations to trace the relationship between the technical practices and rhetoric of TQM. The model shows that managers consume a rhetoric of success about TQM, use that rhetoric to develop their TQM program, and then filter their experiences to present their own rhetoric of success. Consequently, the discourse on TQM develops an overly optimistic view of TQM. The models demonstrate how individual actions and discourse shape TQM and fuel institutional forces.</p>

            <p>We review studies of organizational demography that show empirical relationships between the length of service (tenure) distribution and organizational outcomes. Our theoretical reformulation of the typical explanation offered for these relationships posits a link between heterogeneity in the length of service distribution and heterogeneity in organizational culture. We examine the plausibility of this explanation using a computer simulation of a mathematical model. The model implies that the tenure-culture link is usually positive, as assumed by organizational demographers, but that the strength of this link varies by context. The modeling effort also uncovered several limitations of the conventional research framework. These include (1) the plausibility of simple alternative explanations based on unobserved heterogeneity; (2) the inability to distinguish disruption effects caused by individual entry and exit from diversity effects based on internal social processes; and (3) the conflation of several different hypothesized processes into a single variable measuring tenure heterogeneity. We develop and evaluate three alternative measures, each linked to a different social process.</p>
            <p>The paper develops a network-based mapping of the technological positions of the firms in an industry and applies this model in a longitudinal study of the formation of alliances between organizations. In the analysis, the positions of high-technology firms in their competitive environment are stratified on two dimensions: crowding and prestige. Organizations in crowded positions are those that participate in technological segments in which many firms actively innovate, and prestigious firms are those with a track record of developing seminal inventions. The study's principal empirical findings are that firms in crowded positions and those with high prestige form alliances at the highest rates. The statistical analyses, performed on a sample of semiconductor firms during a six-year period, demonstrate that crowding and prestige predict alliance formations at the firm level (which organizations establish the greatest number of alliances) and at the dyad level (which particular pairs of firms choose to collaborate).</p>

            <p>To understand variations in citizenship behavior within a culture, we examine the relationship between citizenship behaviors and organizational justice in two studies in a Chinese context, using two cultural characteristics (traditionality and modernity) and one individual (gender) characteristic. In Study 1, we develop an indigenous measure of organizational citizenship behavior and explore the similarities and differences of this measure with its Western counterpart. In Study 2, we use this citizenship behavior measure to test its relationship to justice. Results demonstrate that organizational justice (distributive and procedural) is most strongly related to citizenship behavior for individuals who endorse less traditional, or high modernity, values. In addition, we found the relationship between justice and citizenship behavior to be stronger for men than for women. The studies are discussed in terms of the generality of citizenship behavior and its relation to organizational justice and cultural characteristics.</p>

            <p>To examine whether corporate giving had changed during the 1980s, I studied charitable contributions in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota in 1979-81 and 1987-89. There was no support for hypotheses that charitable contributions had decreased, became more tightly coupled to market position, or were less influenced by chief executive officers' social networks. In neither period did the percent of sales to consumers affect contributions; labor intensities had a weak negative effect in 1979-81 and a strong negative effect in 1987-89; and in both periods social network ties to local philanthropic leaders, company performance, and size were positively related to giving, while CEO ownership had a negative effect. Only when firms came under the control of a large outside investor was the effect of network position on contributions significantly weakened.</p>

            <p>Drawing on neoinstitutional and learning theories, we distinguish three distinct modes of selective interorganizational imitation: frequency imitation (copying very common practices), trait imitation (copying practices of other organizations with certain features), and outcome imitation (imitation based on a practice's apparent impact on others). We investigate whether these imitation modes occur independently and are affected by outcome salience and contextual uncertainty in the context of an important decision: which investment banker to use as adviser on an acquisition. Results of testing hypotheses on 539 acquisitions that occurred in 1988-1993 show that all three imitation modes occur independently, but only highly salient outcomes sustain outcome imitation. Uncertainty enhances frequency imitation, but only some trait and outcome imitation. The results highlight the possible joint operation of social and technical indicators in imitation, illuminate factors that moderate vicarious learning processes, and show asymmetries between learning from success and failure.</p>

            <p>To examine the effects of policy on markets and competition we outline hypotheses about the effects of three common policy regimes-public capitalization, pro-cartel, and antitrust-on competition and the founding of new firms. Analyses of Massachusetts railroad foundings between 1825 and 1922 show that public capitalization raises the number of foundings by increasing available resources, pro-cartel policies raise the number of foundings by dampening competition from incumbents, and antitrust depresses foundings by stimulating competition. Ecological factors only show the expected effects once policy is controlled. Industrial organization factors show no net effects. We argue that public policy establishes the ground rules of competition and thus creates varieties of market behavior.</p>
            <p>This paper presents a multifaceted qualitative investigation of everyday conflict in six organizational work teams. Repeated interviews and on-site observations provide data on participants' perceptions, behaviors, and their own analyses of their conflicts, resulting in a generalized conflict model. Model evaluation indicates that relationship conflict is detrimental to performance and satisfaction; process conflict is also detrimental to performance; and task conflict's effects on performance depend on specified dimensions. In particular, emotionality reduces effectiveness, resolution potential and acceptability norms increase effectiveness, and importance accentuates conflict's other effects. Groups with norms that accept task but not relationship conflict are most effective. The model and the findings help to broaden under-standing of dynamics of organizational conflict and suggest ways it can either be alleviated or wisely encouraged.</p>
            <p>The studies reported here evaluated the conditions under which the relationship between employees' trust in and support for organizational authorities will be more or less pronounced. We hypothesized that employees' trust in organizational authorities would be more strongly related to their support for the authorities when they perceived the outcomes associated with authorities' decisions to be relatively unfavorable. The results of three field studies, in markedly different contexts, supported this prediction. In essence, the establishment of trust seems to be a potent force in overcoming the otherwise adverse reactions that employees may exhibit in reaction to decisions yielding unfavorable outcomes. Theoretical implications for the literatures on organizational trust and organizational justice are discussed, as are some practical implications and limitations of the studies.</p>

            <p>In contrast to the punctuated equilibrium model of change, this inductive study of multiple-product innovation in six firms in the computer industry examines how organizations engage in continuous change. Comparisons of successful and less-successful firms show, first, that successful multiple-product innovation blends limited structure around responsibilities and priorities with extensive communication and design freedom to create improvisation within current projects. This combination is neither so structured that change cannot occur nor so unstructured that chaos ensues. Second, successful firms rely on a wide variety of low-cost probes into the future, including experimental products, futurists, and strategic alliances. Neither planning nor reacting is as effective. Third, successful firms link the present and future together through rhythmic, time-paced transition processes. We develop the ideas of "semistructures," "links in time," and "sequenced steps" to crystallize the key properties of these continuously changing organizations and to extend thinking about complexity theory, time-paced evolution, and the nature of core capabilities.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this work is to develop a systematic understanding of embeddedness and organization networks. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted at 23 entrepreneurial firms, I identify the components of embedded relationships and explicate the devices by which embeddedness shapes organizational and economic outcomes. The findings suggest that embeddedness is a logic of exchange that promotes economies of time, integrative agreements, Pareto improvements in allocative efficiency, and complex adaptation. These positive effects rise up to a threshold, however, after which embeddedhess can derail economic performance by making firms vulnerable to exogenous shocks or insulating them from information that exists beyond their network. A framework is proposed that explains how these properties vary with the quality of social ties, the structure of the organization network, and an organization's structural position in the network."</p>

            <p>This study of chain affiliation in the Manhattan hotel industry examines the benefits and drawbacks of affiliation with a chain, which can be a source of operating knowledge and economies of scale for components but also a potential source of strategic constraint. Our analysis demonstrates the effects of chain affiliation on the failure of component organizations and competitive dynamics in the Manhattan hotel industry from 1898 to 1980. Under most circumstances, chain affiliation improves the survival chances of component hotels in Manhattan. All chain memberships are not equal, however, and the survival benefits to components vary systematically with the nature of the operating experience and the number and distribution of components of hotel chains. Our findings show how understanding the role of chains can inform both learning and ecological models of organization.</p>

            <p>This study examines the role of a chief executive officer's hubris, or exaggerated self-confidence, in explaining the large size of some premiums paid for acquisitions. In a sample of 106 large acquisitions, we found that four indicators of CEO hubris are highly associated with the size of premiums paid: the acquiring company's recent performance, recent media praise for the CEO, a measure of the CEO's self-importance, and a composite factor of these three variables. The relationship between CEO hubris and premiums is further strengthened when board vigilance is lacking--when the board has a high proportion of inside directors and when the CEO is also the board chair. On average, we found losses in acquiring firms' shareholder wealth following an acquisition, and the greater the CEO hubris and acquisition premiums, the greater the shareholder losses. Thus, CEO hubris has substantial practical consequences, in addition to having potentially great theoretical significance to observers of strategic behavior.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the question of whether the strongest organizations survive, distinguishing between two aspects of organizational strength. An organization can be strong, as measured by its survival chances. Or an organization can be ecologically strong, as measured by its competitive effects on the birth and survival of other organizations. I develop a model that empirically distinguishes these effects and discuss how these strengths are likely to develop as organizations age and grow. I predict that the strongest competitors are more likely to survive when organizations are small but that viability and competitive strength diverge when organizations are large, leading to the survival of weak competitors. The model is estimated using data on foundings and failures among breweries in the U.S. and telephone companies in Pennsylvania. The results are as predicted and can account for the persistent tendency of organizational populations to become concentrated. The results also imply that as concentration increases, so does the competitive weakness of surviving organizations, setting the stage for the resurgence of organizing characteristic of industrial renewal. Overall, the results indicate that so-called adaptive mechanisms used by individual organizations, when seen in evolutionary perspective, in fact may lead to the survival of weak competitors.</p>

            <p>This study seeks to reconcile traditional sociological views of the corporate board as an instrument of elite cohesion with recent evidence of greater board activism and control over top management. We propose that CEO-directors may typically support fellow CEOs by impeding increased board control over management but that CEO-directors may also foster this change if they have experienced it in their own corporation. Drawing on social exchange theory, we develop and test the argument that these CEO-directors may experience a reversal in the basis for generalized social exchange with other top managers from one of deference and support to one of independence and control. Using data from a large sample of major U.S. corporations over a recent ten-year period, we show (1) how CEO-directors "defect" from the network of mutually supportive corporate leaders, (2) how defections have diffused across organizations and over time, and (3) how this has contributed to increased board control, as measured by changes in board structure, diversification strategy, and contingent compensation. We also provide evidence that a social exchange perspective can explain the diffusion of these changes better than more conventional perspectives on network diffusion that emphasize imitation or learning.</p>

            <p>Language and power are central to an understanding of control. This paper uses the work of Pierre Bourdieu to argue that an enriched view of power, in the form of symbolic violence, is central. We examine the pedagogical function business plans played in the provincial museums and cultural heritage sites of Alberta, Canada. The struggle to name and legitimate practices occurs in the business planning process, excluding some knowledges and practices and teaching and utilizing other knowledges and ways of viewing the organization. We show that control involves both redirecting work and changing the identity of producers, in particular, how they understand their work through the construction of markets, consumers, and products. This process works by changing the capital, in its multiple forms-symbolic, cultural, political and economic-in an organizational and institutional field.</p>

            <p>An ethnographic field study in Big Six public accounting firms, where management by objectives and mentoring are used as techniques of control, examines how organizations transform professionals into disciplined and self-disciplining organizational members whose work goals, language, and lifestyle come to reflect the imperatives of the organization. The study shows that the scope and effect of these techniques shaped the identities of organizational participants but that the discourse of professional autonomy fueled resistance to these pressures toward conformity. Implications of these results are discussed as they relate to conflict between professionals and organizations and to the critical study of organizations.</p>

            <p>Through a qualitative study of a software development group, I examine how managers control the hours employees work, and therefore the temporal boundary between employees' work and life outside of work. Analysis of field data shows that managers use three types of techniques to exert boundary control over "knowledge workers": (1) imposing demands, by setting meetings, reviews, and internal deadlines, controlling vacations, and requesting extra work; (2) monitoring employees, by standing over them, checking up on them, and observing them; and (3) modeling the behavior they want employees to exhibit. Employees either accept or resist managers' boundary control; those who resist are penalized by the reward system, even when they devise creative ways to schedule and complete their work. Many employees are married, and the demands of their work have consequences for their spouses. Spouses' reactions to the demands that ultimately affect them further influence how employees respond to boundary control. These findings contribute to a theory of boundary control and carry practical implications for resolving work-family conflicts in our society.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the role of accounting calculations in the process of reorganizing the manufacturing capabilities of a vertically integrated global retailing company. In contrast to mainstream analyses that emphasize the novelty and mutual benefits of teamwork, we show how its introduction to replace line work extended rather than supplanted traditional, hierarchical systems of management control. Management's intention was to engender a self-managing means of continuous improvement of working practices, but the self-managing demands of teamwork contravened workers' established sense of self-identity as "machinists" and "mates." Output was raised by changing to a group bonus system, but the move to teamwork had the unintended effect of fermenting hostility toward the managerial goal of making the teams fully self-managing.</p>
            <p>This article proposes a new model of industrial labor process control that maintains discipline under conditions of teamwork. The model draws on theoretical and empirical studies to examine how work monitoring undertaken using management information systems interacts with the peer-group scrutiny that goes on in teams. These represent "vertical" and "horizontal" forms of surveillance, respectively, creating the conditions for a hybrid or "chimerical" mode of workplace control to operate. The article concludes by assessing the practical and theoretical implications that the model holds for further studies of the labor process.</p>

            <p>Using qualitative data from a large, successful private sector corporation (The Body Shop International), which was managed and staffed by an unusually high proportion of women, this paper questions whether norms of impersonality need be a defining characteristic of large organizations. We also ask whether displays of emotions in organizations need to be managed primarily for instrumental purposes, a form of emotional labor that entails costs for employees. This paper explores the viability of an alternative emotion management approach, "bounded emotionality," which encourages the constrained expression of emotions at work in order to encourage community building and personal well-being in the workplace. We show how bounded emotionality was enacted and explore difficulties in its implementation, including pressures on employees who prefer impersonality and the dangers of a deeper and more intimate form of controlling employees. Results show that rapid firm growth, a limited labor market, and the pressures of a competitive marketplace serve as boundary conditions for the maintenance of bounded emotionality.</p>

            <p>Drawing on ethnographic case study material from one kibbutz and secondary material on the movement generally, this article explores the organization and control of the labor process of the communal socialist Israeli kibbutz. While not oblivious to the problems of the kibbutz movement, the research indicates that workers do determine the organization and control of its industrial labor process. These findings are discussed in the context of labor process analysis, which has neglected the kibbutz. By inviting a comparison between the kibbutz and the labor processes of capitalism and state socialism, this study offers an opportunity for a theoretical reevaluation of socialism and a broadening of appreciation for the empirical possibilities in the organization and control of the labor process generally.</p>

            <p>This study examines how the movement of top managers across organizations (executive migration) over an 18-year period in the semiconductor industry influences strategic change, specifically, entry into new product markets. Results support the argument that executive migration brings managers into the organization with prior exposure to different products and strategies, which in turn is reflected in subsequent product-market entry decisions by the executive's new firm. Results also show that the effects of executive migration are influenced by attributes of the executive and characteristics of the top management team of the focal firm. The effects of executive migration on product-market entry are stronger when the new managers came from the functions of R&amp;D and engineering, when they reported to the chief executive in their former organization, and when they had greater industry experience. Attributes of the focal firm's top management team also appear to moderate the influence of the new executive. Smaller top management teams and teams with shorter tenures demonstrate a stronger relationship between executive migration and strategic change.</p>
            <p>A simulation model that formalizes the conventional theory of punctuated organizational change highlights a problem: under a wide range of conditions, organizations appear to fail following reorientation. I propose additions to the theory to account for punctuated transformation. The first adds a routine for monitoring organization-environment consistency; the second is a heuristic that suspends change for a trial period following a reorientation. I show the necessity of the trial period in simulations demonstrating that, while external events may set the pace of organizational change in some environments, under turbulent conditions successful change requires internal pacing, which suspends performance evaluation for a period following a reorientation.</p>
            <p>This article uses data from a field study of five large U.S. restaurant chains to model how chains use a plural form-simultaneous use of company and franchise units-to maintain uniformity and achieve systemwide adaptation to changing markets. From interview and observational data, I identify organizational structure, control systems, career paths, and strategy-making processes as four means through which the combination of company and franchise units helps chains achieve their objectives. The paper shows how the control and innovation processes provided by this plural form ameliorate some of the weaknesses and leverage some of the strengths of the company and franchise arrangements, enhancing the performance of the chain overall.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we examine two distinct perspectives that explain entrepreneurs' choice of product and geographic location, which determine demand for the output of a start-up and the competition it faces. According to the differentiation perspective, fear of direct competition pushes firms far apart from similar competitors, while benefits of complementary differences pull firms close to dissimilar competitors. According to the agglomeration perspective, spillovers from adjacent competitors pull firms close to similar competitors. Our analysis of multidimensional founding location decisions in the Manhattan hotel industry provides evidence to support a combined perspective in which hoteliers locate new hotels sufficiently close to established hotels that are similar on one product dimension (price) to benefit from agglomeration economies, but different on another product dimension (size), to avoid localized competition and create complementary differences.</p>

            <p>I present argument and evidence for a structural ecology of social capital that describes how the value of social capital to an individual is contingent on the number of people doing the same work. The information and control benefits of bridging the structural holes-or, disconnections between nonredundant contacts in a network-that constitute social capital are especially valuable to managers with few peers. Such managers do not have the guiding frame of reference for behavior provided by numerous competitors, and the work they do does not have the legitimacy provided by numerous people doing the same kind of work. I use network and performance data on a probability sample of senior managers to show how the value of social capital, high on average for the managers, varies as a power function of the number of people doing the same work.</p>

            <p>This study develops a theoretical framework that integrates institutional and network perspectives on the form and consequences of administrative innovations. Hypotheses are tested with survey and archival data on the implementation of total quality management (TQM) programs and the consequences for organizational efficiency and legitimacy in a sample of over 2,700 U.S. hospitals. The results show that early adopters customize TQM practices for efficiency gains, while later adopters gain legitimacy from adopting the normative form of TQM programs. The findings suggest that institutional factors moderate the role of network membership in affecting the form of administrative innovations adopted and provide strong evidence for the importance of institutional factors in determining how innovations are defined and implemented. We discuss implications for theory and research on institutional processes and network effects and for the literatures on innovation adoption and total quality management.</p>

            <p>Recent perspectives on organizational change have emphasized human agency, more than technology or structure, to explain empirical outcomes resulting from the use of information technologies in organizations. Yet, newer technologies such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems continue to be associated with the agenda of organizational transformation, largely because they are assumed to constrain human action. We report an interpretive case study of an ERP system after its implementation in a large government agency. Despite the transformation agenda accompanying the new system, users initially chose to avoid using it as much as possible (inertia) and later to work around system constraints in unintended ways (reinvention). We explain the change in enactments with the concept of improvised learning, which was motivated by social influence from project leaders. "power users," and peers. Our results are consistent with arguments regarding the enactment of information technology in organizations and with temporal views of human agency. We conclude that an integrated technology like ERP, which potentially represents a "hard" constraint on human agency, can be resisted and reinvented in use.</p>
            <p>Identification is a person's sense of belonging with a social category. Identification in virtual organizational teams is thought to be especially desirable because it provides the glue that can promote group cohesion despite the relative lack of face-to-face interaction. Though research on virtual teams is exploding, it has not systematically identified the antecedents or moderators of the process by which identification develops, leaving a number of gaps and apparent contradictions. The purpose of this paper is to begin to untangle the contradictions and address some of the gaps by tracing the mechanisms and moderating processes through which identification develops in hybrid and pure virtual settings, and the ways that these processes differ from face-to-face settings.</p>
            <p>We propose a normative model of transactional negotiation in which cooperative and competitive behaviors wax and wane across four stages: relational positioning, identifying the problem, generating solutions, and reaching agreement. Based on a classic proposition of communicative flexibility in high-context cultures, we propose culture-specific dyadic movements within and across these stages. Our sample included 102 high-context dyads from Russia, Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand; 89 low-context dyads from Germany, Israel, Sweden, and the United States; and 45 United States-Hong Kong and United States-Japan mixed-context dyads. Dyads negotiated a complex, 90-minute transaction with integrative potential. We audiotaped, transcribed, and coded their negotiations for sequences of information and influence behaviors. The unit of analysis was the action-response sequence. Results confirmed that the pattern of sequences varied across the four stages and the frequency of particular sequences varied with culture. We suggest that negotiators can use this model to manage the evolution and strategic focus of their negotiation, especially during the first two stages, when the use of influence-information sequences and reciprocal-information sequences generate the groundwork for joint gains.</p>
            <p>We suggest that the type of complementary assets (generic versus specialized) needed to commercialize a new technology is critical in determining the industry- and firm-level performance implications of a competence-destroying technological discontinuity. At the industry level, we hypothesize that incumbent industry performance declines if the new technology can be commercialized through generic complementary assets, whereas incumbent industry performance improves if the new technology can be commercialized through specialized complementary assets. At the firm level, we posit that an incumbent firm's financial strength has a stronger positive impact on firm performance in the postdiscontinuity time period if the new technology can be commercialized through generic complementary assets. We hypothesize, however, that an incumbent firm's R&amp;D capability has a stronger positive impact on firm performance in the postdiscontinuity time period if the new technology can be commercialized through specialized complementary assets. Drawing on multi-industry, time series, and panel data over a 26-year period to analyze pre- and postdiscontinuity industry and firm performance, we find broad support for our theoretical model.</p>
            <p>Organizations' trade secrets (which can be chemical formulae, recipes, customer files, machinery designs, or many other types of information) are often valuable, enduring sources of competitive advantage. In this study, the influence of organizations' formal efforts to protect trade secrets on employees' beliefs about their obligations to protect those secrets was investigated. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered by means of survey interviews with 111 employees of two high-tech organizations. Employees' obligations were influenced by their levels of familiarity with, and their perceptions of the enforcement of, two types of trade secret protection procedures (TSPPs): trade secret access restriction procedures (ARs) and trade secret handling procedures (HPs). Employees' levels of familiarity with ARs were negatively related to their felt obligations to protect trade secrets, but the opposite was true for HPs: Employees' levels of familiarity with HPs were positively related to the obligations they felt to protect trade secrets. For both types of TSPPs, the relationship between familiarity and felt obligations was moderated by employees' perceptions of the degree to which the TSPPs were enforced.</p>
            <p>Since the Second World War, the field of organizations studies has grown substantially in the number of researchers, number of publications, and amount of research produced. It has moved from being a combination of established disciplines to becoming a quasi-discipline of its own, with its own journals and professional associations. It has established a standardized set of ancestors, a stylized history. It has solidified an academic home in business schools. This history has implications for understanding both the future of organizations research and the social dynamics of the development of scholarly communities.</p>
            <p>We use an innovative technique to examine an enduring but recently neglected question: How do environmental turbulence and complexity affect the appropriate formal design of organizations? We construct an agent-based simulation in which multidepartment firms with different designs face environments whose turbulence and complexity we control. The model's results produce two sets of testable hypotheses. One set pinpoints formal designs that cope well with three different environments: turbulent settings, in which firms must improve their performance speedily; complex environments, in which firms must search broadly; and settings with both turbulence and complexity, in which firms must balance speed and search. The results shed new light on longstanding notions such as equifinality. The other set of hypotheses argues that the impact of individual design elements on speed and search often depends delicately on specific powers granted to department heads, creating effects that run contrary to conventional wisdom and intuition. Ample processing power at the bottom of a firm, for instance, can slow down the improvement and narrow the search of the firm as a whole. Differences arise between our results and conventional wisdom when conventional thinking fails to account for the powers of department heads-powers to withhold information about departmental options, to control decision-making agendas, to veto firmwide alternatives, and to take unilateral action. Our results suggest how future empirical studies of organizational design might be fruitfully coupled with rigorous agent-based modeling efforts.</p>
            <p>This study examines factors influencing changes in the top management of start-up firms. Whereas a significant amount of research has examined top management transitions in established firms, we know much less about the factors influencing the evolution of top management capabilities in a new firm. Our research examines these issues in a sample of new ventures founded from 1983 through 1995, examining each firm for seven years after its founding to evaluate the conditions that influence a firm's changes in top management. Results indicate that top management team changes occur in cases of very low or very high firm growth, but are mitigated by a functionally diverse top management team. Power and control of inside and outside constituencies also affect changes in top management, with venture capital ownership and board representation increasing change in top management, and managerial ownership decreasing changes.</p>
            <p>In this paper, I develop a perspective on women's career attainment focused on how employers' salary offers may be constructed based on their assumptions regarding women's access to comparative salary information. Therefore, although the use of social networks in job search may enhance women's actual knowledge of prevailing wages, I hypothesize that institutional characteristics that employers could assume to constrain women's networks and concomitant access to salary information will directly affect salary offers, as well as moderating the influence of network ties on pay. To test this perspective, job search outcomes of women attending elite coeducational and women's colleges were examined. Regarding the number of offers obtained, women who consulted with proportionally more male peer and employed adult male advice ties received significantly more job offers than women using fewer male advice contacts. With regard to salary offers, this study reveals an institutional sex composition effect: women exiting single-sex institutions (i.e., women's colleges) received significantly lower salary offers than women from coeducational schools, even after accounting for human capital, job characteristics, and institutional reputation. The effects of social networks on pay were moderated by institutional sex composition such that women exiting women's colleges received lower returns in the form of salary to their cross-gender advice ties than did women from a matched coeducational institution. Implications of these results for theories of social capital and women's occupational attainment are discussed.</p>
            <p>If communities of practice (Lave and Wenger 1991) are best understood as fluid social relations, enacted among a self-selected group of participants, then are they best left alone, free from "interference" by organizational managers and policymakers? Or are there ways in which organizations can provide helpful support to such communities, without constraining the delicate dynamic by which they are sustained? This paper supports the latter position, arguing that organizations should sponsor the creation of certain loose organizational structures, around which it is hoped that communities of practice may then interact. However, some recent empirical research is presented suggesting that attempts to control group interaction by introducing too much structure are likely to result in the demise of the community itself. It is therefore proposed that there are lower and upper parameters for structural intervention in communities of practice. It is suggested that such communities also have epistemic parameters, where participants' willingness to express their ideas as conceptual boundary objects around which others may engage and develop ideas is a minimum requirement, but where too much inward communicative focus is likely to result in gradual loss of meaning, with a negative effect on the community. In developing this position, this paper attempts to deepen our theoretical understanding of the interrelationship between organizational structure and the epistemic activity of members of communities of practice. Several practical implications of these insights are discussed for organizations wishing to cultivate and maintain communities of practice within their own working environments.</p>
            <p>The notion of integration is central to the understanding of organizations in general as well as of contemporary phenomena such as e-commerce, virtual organizations, virtual teams, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementation. Yet, the concept of integration is ill-defined in the literature, and the impact of achieving high levels of integration is not well understood. The present paper addresses these issues. Drawing on the literature of several fields, this paper proposes the concept of organizational integration (OI), which is defined as the extent to which distinct and interdependent organizational components constitute a unified whole. Six types of OI are identified: two intraorganizational OI (internal-operational, internal-functional) and four interorganizational OI (external-operational-forward, external-operational-backward, external-operational-lateral, and external-functional). This paper then presents a model and develops 14 propositions to predict (1) the effort needed to implement different types of OI, (2) the impact different types of OI will have on organizational performance, and (3) how six factors (interdependence, barriers to OI, mechanisms for achieving OI, environmental turbulence, complexity reduction mechanisms, and organizational configurations) influence the relationship between OI types, implementation effort, and organizational performance. The OI framework and model are then used to develop 14 propositions for ERP implementation research and to explain the findings of recent research on integration.</p>
            <p>Articles in high-prestige journals receive more citations and more applause than articles in less-prestigious journals, but how much more do these articles contribute to knowledge? This article uses a statistical theory of review processes to draw inferences about differences value between articles in more-prestigious versus less-prestigious journals. This analysis indicates that there is much overlap in articles in different prestige strata. Indeed, theory implies that about half of the articles published are not among the best ones submitted to those journals, and some of the manuscripts that belong in the highest-value 20% have the misfortune to elicit rejections from as many as five journals. Some social science departments and business schools strongly emphasize publication in prestigious journals. Although one can draw inferences about an author's average manuscript from the percentage in top-tier journals, the confidence limits for such inferences are wide. A focus on prestigious journals may benefit the most prestigious departments or schools but add randomness to the decisions of departments or schools that are not at the very top. Such a focus may also impede the development of knowledge when mediocre research receives the endorsement of high visibility.</p>
            <p>This paper builds on the principles and insights from improvisational theater to unpack the nature of collective improvisation and to consider what it takes to do it well and to innovate. Furthermore, we discuss the role of training in enhancing the incidence and effectiveness of improvisation. We propose that two common misconceptions about improvisation have hindered managers' understanding of how to develop the improvisational skill. First, the spontaneous facet of improvisation tends to be overemphasized, and second, there is a general assumption that improvisation always leads to positive performance. Our goal is to clear up the conceptual confusion about improvisation by laying out the various aspects of preparation that are required for effective improvisation. In our theoretical model, we delineate how the improvisational theater principles of "practice," "collaboration," "agree, accept, and add," "be present in the moment," and "draw on reincorporation and ready-mades" can be used to understand what it takes to improvise well in work teams and to create a context favoring these efforts. Our findings support a contingent view of the impact of improvisation on innovative performance. Improvisation is not inherently good or bad; however, improvisation has a positive effect on team innovation when combined with team and contextual moderating factors. We also provide initial evidence suggesting that the improvisational skill can be learned by organizational members through training. Our results shed light on the opportunities provided by training in improvisation and on the challenges of creating behavioral change going beyond the individual to the team and, ultimately, to the organization.</p>
            <p>This paper develops a theory that predicts why firms organize their knowledge workers as employees versus independent contractors and predicts the performance implications of this choice. It then empirically examines this organizational choice-which our theory predicts will be driven by contracting difficulties arising from expropriation concerns, measurement costs, and interdependence-and its implications for profitability for 190 information technology service projects. Using a two-stage switching regression model, our analysis shows that projects aligned according to our theory are on average more profitable than misaligned projects and that firm capability impacts organizational choice but not profitability.</p>
            <p>As workers strive to manage multiple roles such as work and family, research has begun to focus on how people manage the boundary between work and nonwork roles. This paper contributes to emerging work on boundary theory by examining the extent to which individuals desire to integrate or segment their work and nonwork lives. This desire is conceptualized and measured on a continuum ranging from segmentation (i.e., separation) to integration (i.e., blurring) of work and nonwork roles. We examine the fit between individuals' desires for integration/segmentation and their access to policies that enable boundary management, suggesting that more policies may not always be better in terms of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Using survey methodology and a sample of 460 employees, we found that desire for greater segmentation does moderate the relationship between the organizational policies one has access to and individuals' satisfaction and commitment. People who want more segmentation are less satisfied and committed to the organization when they have greater access to integrating policies (e.g., onsite childcare) than when they have less access to such policies. Conversely, people who want greater segmentation are more committed when they have greater access to segmenting policies (e.g., flextime) than when they have less access to such policies. Moreover, the fit between desire for segmentation and organizational policy has an effect on satisfaction and commitment over and above the effects of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, income, number of children, and the ages of those children.</p>
            <p>This study examines the interactive effect of technological intensiveness and top management group (TMG) pay disparity on firm performance. Drawing on two literatures-task interdependence and group rewards-we argue that: (a) technological intensiveness imposes a considerable requirement for multiway information processing and collaboration among senior executives of a firm, and (b) collaboration is diminished when large pay disparities exist. Hence, TMG pay disparity should be more detrimental to subsequent performance of high-technology firms than low-technology firms. We construct seven different measures of executive pay disparity based on three major types of pay disparity (vertical, horizontal, and overall) and use a proprietary data set to test our hypotheses. The results provide consistent support for our hypotheses, thereby suggesting important implications for scholars and designers of executive compensation.</p>
            <p>This study investigated employees' choice of social referents and the impact of social influence on their beliefs of psychological contract fulfillment. Using data from a field study conducted with 99 employees in a research organization, we found that one's referent choice varied with the domain of promise evaluated. When evaluating the organization's fulfillment of organization-wide promises, employees' referents were primarily coworkers with whom they had close direct ties, namely, friends and advice givers. On the other hand, when evaluating the fulfillment of job-related promises, employees' referents were mainly fellow workers who could substitute for them and people with whom they had multiple relationships. The effects of social influence also varied with the domain of promise evaluated. For organization-wide promises, employees' fulfillment evaluations were similar to those of their friends. However, for job-related promises, their fulfillment evaluations were dissimilar to those of coworkers who played the dual roles of friends and substitutes. This study advances psychological contracts research by demonstrating that third parties to the psychological contract can influence fulfillment evaluations. In turn, the effect of such influence is contingent on the domain of promises being evaluated and the nature of the networks. We discuss implications for research in psychological contracts, social networks and influence, and referent choice.</p>
            <p>Geographically distributed teams are increasingly prevalent in the workplace, and research on distributed teams is ever more available. Despite this increased attention, we still know surprisingly little about how the dynamics of distributed teams differ from those of their collocated counterparts and how existing models of teams apply to this new form of work. For example, although it has been argued that distributed as compared with collocated teams have more severe conflicts that fester longer and resist resolution, few comparative studies investigate dynamics such as conflict in both distributed and collocated teams. In this study, we examine conflict, its antecedents, and its effects on performance in distributed as compared with collocated teams. Our goal is to understand how conflict plays out in distributed and collocated teams, thus providing insight into how existing models of conflict must be augmented to reflect the trend toward distributed work. We report the results of a field study of 43 teams, 22 collocated and 21 distributed, from a large multinational company. As expected, the distributed teams reported more task and interpersonal conflict than did the collocated teams. We found evidence that shared identity moderated the effect of distribution on interpersonal conflict and that shared context moderated the effect of distribution on task conflict. Finally, we found that spontaneous communication played a pivotal role in the relationship between distribution and conflict. First, spontaneous communication was associated with a stronger shared identity and more shared context, our moderating variables. Second, spontaneous communication had a direct moderating effect on the distribution-conflict relationship, mitigating the effect of distribution on both types of conflict. We argue that this effect reflects the role of spontaneous communication in facilitating conflict identification and conflict handling.</p>
            <p>Globalizing knowledge economies foster conditions that intensify the role and value of organizational reputation risk. In an enterprise-focused era, reputation is a key strategic construct that can act as a boundary object linking communities within and between organizations. Yet approaches to its management tend to be reactive and remain under the hold of industrial society principles. Definitions of reputation risk in the existing literature and the business community have a tendency to be static and asset oriented. We suggest that this contrasts sharply with insights on the social construction of knowledge that inform recent risk studies. Drawing on this critique, we argue that the ambivalence engendered by on-going processes of definition (responsibilities, boundaries, fact construction) characterizing the knowledge society demands a reconceptualization of reputation risk. We propose a reconceptualization of reputation risk that not only incorporates a more sophisticated view of reputation, but also acknowledges the role that risk and trust relations can play in its constitution. In addition to contributing to the theoretical development of reputation risk in the organization studies literature, we develop the notion of reputable action as a guiding principle for realizing active trust development in the practical management of reputation risk.</p>
            <p>This paper argues that research in organization theory has seen a shift in orientation from paradigm-driven work to problem-driven work since the late 1980s. A number of paradigms for the study of organizations were elaborated during the mid-1970s, including transaction cost economics, resource dependence theory, organizational ecology, new institutional theory, and agency theory in financial economics. These approaches reflected the dominant trends of the large corporations of their time: increasing concentration, diversification, and bureaucratization. However, subsequent shifts in organizational boundaries, the increased use of alliances and network forms, and the expanding role of financial markets in shaping organizational decision making all make normal science driven by the internally derived questions from these paradigms less fruitful. Instead, we argue that problem-driven work that uses mechanism-based theorizing and research that takes the field rather than the organization as the unit of analysis are the most appropriate styles of organizational research under conditions of major economic change-such as our own era. This sort of work is best exemplified by various studies under the rubric of institutional theory in the past 15 years, which are reviewed here.</p>
            <p>We explore the concept of regional industrial identity as an important missing component in our understanding of the development of metropolitan regions and the spatial arrangements of industries. While economists and sociologists have explained the location of industry clusters on the basis of unevenly distributed resources, and historians have provided rich descriptive insight into the developmental dynamics of particular metropolitan regions, little systematic theory has been advanced to explain cross-regional inflows and outflows of resources, especially with respect to patterns in cluster development. This paper examines the concept of regional industrial identity as a social code that (1) arises from the shared understandings of residents and external audiences about the suitability of a region for particular kinds of business activity and (2) influences decisions about where to locate investments. We argue that such understandings are principally informed by configurations of industry clusters that have already formed in a region. Clusters, which are the results of historical investments, are also important signals about the types of business that can thrive in the future. We develop theoretical propositions linking characteristics of regional industry cluster configurations, in particular cluster dominance and cluster interrelatedness, to the strength and focus of regional identity and, as a result, to the types and amounts of resources that will develop within and flow into and out of regions.</p>
            <p>The role of individual action in the enactment of structures of constraint and opportunity has proved to be particularly elusive for network researchers. We propose three frontiers for future network research that zoom back and forth between individual and collective levels of analysis. First, we consider how dilemmas concerning social capital can be reconciled. Actors striving to reap maximal network advantages may benefit or detract from the collective good; investigating these trade-offs, we argue, will advance our understanding of learning and knowledge processes in organizations. Second, we explore identity emergence and change from a social network perspective. Insights about how networks mold and signal identity are a critical foundation for future work on career dynamics and the workplace experiences of members of diverse groups. Third, we consider how individual cognitions about shifting network connections affect, and are affected by, larger social structures. As scholarly interest in status and reputational signaling grows, articulating more clearly the cognitive foundations of organizational networks becomes imperative.</p>
            <p>In developing and advancing organization theory, it is useful if we can uncover fundamental constructs that can then be used to integrate larger areas of inquiry, even as we continue to accumulate more knowledge, evidence, and concepts. However, accomplishing this will require a somewhat different approach to theory building and testing. We illustrate the process of building an integrated model from fundamental constructs by using the idea of self-enhancement to explore phenomena of power and influence. We argue that many psychological processes related to power and social influence (such as escalation of commitment, similarity attraction and in-group favoritism, the disinhibiting effects of power, and the persistence of hierarchical structures) can all be logically derived from the self-enhancement idea, the desire to see oneself and one's actions in a positive light. The conceptual model can help us understand apparently anomalous behavior (such as individuals being willing to tolerate poor treatment at the hands of leaders), bringing together a number of ideas and constructs frequently treated as distinct in the literature and providing some hypotheses for future research.</p>
            <p>The design of work has been and will continue to be a central problem challenging organization theory and practice. The system of arrangements and procedures for doing work affects all workers every day throughout the world. Work is changing dramatically. In an increasingly global and knowledge-intensive economy, work design is no longer contained within an organization; it often transcends the boundaries of organizations and countries. These changes call for a renewed research focus on work design. Building on configuration and complexity perspectives, we propose a framework for studying work design. We argue that three issues require attention to advance the knowledge of work design: (1) defining the boundaries of work systems, (2) examining how the system is nested in a hierarchy within and between organizations, and (3) determining interactions between the elements of a work system. We propose a method of frontier analysis for identifying equifinal designs-the set of equally effective work designs for different combinations of inputs (situations or contexts) and outputs (performance criteria). When work designs are examined longitudinally, these methods permit an examination of adaptation processes on changing fitness landscapes, suggesting how work systems may increase, decrease, or sustain their relative performance over time.</p>
            <p>Sensemaking involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its central role in the determination of human behavior, whether people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere. Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected, some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of which have changed in significance over time, and some of which have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward looking, more infused with emotion and with issues of sensegiving and persuasion. These key enhancements provide a foundation upon which to build future studies that can strengthen the sensemaking perspective.</p>
            <p>Using the established definition of situated cognition in organizations as "the interaction of cognitive schemas and organizational context" (Lant 2002), we examine empirical case studies from the last 15 years to illustrate what situated cognitions in organizations might actually look like. Grounded in this research, we develop a framework that identifies how some specific forms of cognitive schemas (i.e., rule schemas, event schemas, person schemas) and specific contexts (e.g., physical contexts, institutional contexts) interact during sensemaking processes to give rise to momentary perceptions that we call situated cognitions. We present evidence that common patterns of interaction between schemas and context may occur during sensemaking in organizations. In terms of theoretical implications, our framework focuses attention on the specific interactions between context and cognition (rather than on context or cognition alone) that comprise situated cognitions, and helps to more concretely define situated cognitions as momentary or temporally bounded perceptions. We offer several practical implications of this framework for managers and suggest avenues for further elaboration on our ideas through research.</p>
            <p>We advocate a full-cycle approach to conducting organizational behavior research. Full-cycle research begins with the observation of naturally occurring phenomena and proceeds by traveling back and forth between observation and manipulation-based research settings, establishing the power, generality, and conceptual underpinnings of the phenomenon along the way. Compared with more traditional approaches, full-cycle research offers several advantages, such as specifying theoretical models, considering actual and ideal conditions, and promoting interdisciplinary integration. To illustrate these advantages, we provide examples of an implicit approach to conducting full-cycle research and present suggestions for fostering more explicit full-cycle research programs in the future. We encourage individual researchers to adopt this approach rather than to assume the field will naturally avoid the inevitable vulnerabilities that emerge from relying on particular methodological approaches. We conclude by discussing the relevant constraints and opportunities for engaging in full-cycle organizational research.</p>
            <p>Organizational fields undergo upheavals. Shifting industry boundaries, new network forms, emerging sectors, and volatile ecosystems have become the stuff of everyday organizational life. Curiously, profound changes of this sort receive scant attention in organization theory and research. Researchers acknowledge fieldwide flux, emergence, convergence, and collapse, but sidestep direct investigations of the causes and dynamic processes, leaving these efforts to political scientists and institutional economists. We attribute this neglect to our field's philosophical, theoretical, and methodological fealty to the precepts of equilibrium and linearity. We argue that ingrained assumptions and habituated methodologies dissuade organizational scientists from grappling with problems to which these ideas and tools do not apply. Nevertheless, equilibrium and linearity are assumptions of social theory, not facts of social life. Drawing on four empirical studies of organizational fields in flux, we suggest new intellectual perspectives and methodological heuristics that may facilitate investigation of fields that are far from equilibrium. We urge our colleagues to transcend the general linear model, and embrace ideas like field configuration, complex adaptive systems, self-organizing networks, and autocatalytic feedback. We recommend conducting natural histories of organizational fields, and paying especially close attention to turning points when fields are away from equilibrium and discontinuous changes are afoot.</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis within organizational ecology on identity as a fundamental basis for the conceptualization and identification of organizational forms. This paper highlights the benefits of an identity-based conceptualization of organizational forms and outlines an identity-based agenda for organizational ecology. We begin by discussing fundamental properties of organizational identity, drawing extensively from the formal-theoretical conceptualization proposed by P√≥los et al. (2002). We then build on this foundation by proposing a number of systematic ways in which forms can be specified and differentiated in terms of identity. We also address the challenge of measuring forms by discussing various approaches researchers may use to assess the beliefs contemporaneous audiences hold regarding organizational identities. This paper concludes with a discussion of research questions revolving around three issues core to an ecological approach to organizations: (1) the emergence of identities, (2) the persistence of identities, and (3) the strategic trade-offs among different types of identities.</p>
            <p>Organizational boundaries are a central phenomenon, yet despite their significance, research is dominated by transaction cost economics and related exchange-efficiency perspectives. While useful, it is time to engage in a broader view. Our purpose is to provide a deeper understanding of organizational boundaries. First, we develop four boundary conceptions (efficiency, power, competence, and identity) and their distinctive features including organizational and environmental assumptions, unique conception of boundaries, theoretical arguments, empirical validity, contributions, and limitations. Efficiency takes a legal-ownership view of atomistic boundary decisions. In contrast, the power conception emphasizes the sphere of influence of the organization, while competence focuses on the resource portfolio and its related configuration, and identity centers on the often unconscious mind-set by which organizational members understand "who we are." We also indicate relationships, both coevolutionary and synergistic, among the conceptions. Second, we juxtapose these conceptions with the current literature to create a springboard for a renewed research agenda. This agenda includes greater focus on nonefficiency perspectives, relationships (not competition) among boundary conceptions, studies that take the normative implication of theories more seriously, and problem-driven research on contemporary boundary issues such as contract employment and business ecosystems.</p>
            <p>Organizational theorists have long acknowledged the importance of the formal and informal incentives facing a firm's employees, stressing that the political economy of a firm plays a major role in shaping organizational life and firm behavior. Yet the detailed study of incentive systems has traditionally been left in the hands of (organizational) economists, with most organizational theorists focusing their attention on critical problems in culture, network structure, framing, and so on-in essence, the social context in which economics and incentive systems are embedded. We argue that this separation of domains is problematic. The economics literature, for example, is unable to explain why organizations should find it difficult to change incentive structures in the face of environmental change, while the organizational literature focuses heavily on the role of inertia as sources of organizational rigidity. Drawing on recent research on incentives in organizational economics and on cognition in organizational theory, we build a framework for the analysis of incentives that highlights the ways in which incentives and cognition-while being analytically distinct concepts-are phenomenologically deeply intertwined. We suggest that incentives and cognition coevolve so that organizational competencies or routines are as much about building knowledge of "what should be rewarded" as they are about "what should be done." We argue that this recognition has important implications for our understanding of organizational inertia in the face of environmental change, and that it opens up important new areas for further research.</p>
            <p>Sustained organizational performance depends on top management teams effectively exploring and exploiting. These strategic agendas are, however, associated with contradictory organizational architectures. Using the literature on paradox, contradictions, and conflict, we develop a model of managing strategic contradictions that is associated with paradoxical cognition-senior leaders and/or their teams (a) articulating a paradoxical frame, (b) differentiating between the strategy and architecture for the existing product and those for innovation, and (c) integrating between those strategies and architectures. We further argue that the locus of paradox in top management teams resides either with the senior leader or with the entire team. We identify a set of top management team conditions that facilitates a team's ability to engage in paradoxical cognitive processes.</p>
            <p>Thriving describes an individual's experience of vitality and learning. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a model that illuminates the social embeddedness of employees' thriving at work. First, we explain why thriving is a useful theoretical construct, define thriving, and compare it to related constructs, including resilience, flourishing, subjective well-being, flow, and self-actualization. Second, we describe how work contexts facilitate agentic work behaviors, which in turn produce resources in the doing of work and serve as the engine of thriving. Third, we describe how thriving serves as a gauge to facilitate self-adaptation at work. We conclude by highlighting key theoretical contributions of the model and suggesting directions for future research.</p>
            <p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is the primary federal agency funding nonmedical research in the United States. However, relatively few organizational researchers consider approaching the agency, despite the funds it has available. It is easy to understand why: The agency has a reputation for preferring "hard science" and quantitative approaches, and there is no obvious home for organizational studies in the agency. NSF programs appear to recognize psychological and small-group research on the one hand, and sociological research on the other, with little emphasis on organizations. There are, however, several programs that have funded research on organizations, or relevant to organizations. Additionally, the NSF regularly solicits advice and direction from researchers on new directions for focus and attention. We argue that organization researchers should indeed approach NSF with robust research proposals. We provide suggestions for finding an appropriate application "home" within NSF. We also discuss the process of proposal preparation, offering suggestions on how to prepare a persuasive proposal, with comments on how the review process works. Finally, we close with a clarion call for organization researchers to help NSF understand the importance of organizations, and thus of organization research, to the whole array of the agency's other research interests-to the effective practice of science; to organizing human activity, including economic and educational activity; and to management and governance of human activities in general. As such, we argue, NSF has a stake in organizational research-and organizational researchers have a stake in NSF.</p>
            <p>Strategy research typically traces stable performance differences among firms to a priori heterogeneity in initial resource endowments or in expected flows of resources. The objective of this paper is to explore how this heterogeneity is created and how it affects firm technological performance. Within the framework of an evolutionary view of technological change, we develop the notion of technological preadaptation to describe that part of a firm's prior experience that is accumulated without anticipation of subsequent uses. In particular, we hypothesize that (technological) performance differences are positively related to (1) firms' stock of relevant skills and knowledge potentially available for applications other than those for which they were originally developed and (2) the extent to which firms actually build on these skills and knowledge in new domains. The empirical setting is fiber optics technology as it evolved for use in long-distance communications between 1970 and 1995. We find that "preadapted" firms that consistently leveraged their prior experience achieved higher levels of performance than did firms that did not leverage that experience or did not have prior experience. The study illustrates the importance of preadaptation in capability development and technological competition.</p>
            <p>Knowledge embedded in a group's structures and processes can be leveraged to create sustainable advantage for organizations. We propose that knowledge embedded with a transactive memory system (TMS) helps groups apply prior learning to new tasks and develop an abstract understanding of a problem domain, leading to sustained performance. We present a framework for understanding TMSs as learning systems that affect group learning and learning transfer, and we test the major outcomes of the framework in an empirical study. We found that groups with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles relevant to the task domain-a critical factor for learning transfer in general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a TMS affects members' ability to apply prior learning and develop a collective, abstract understanding of the task domain. More generally, our study demonstrates that TMSs influence group learning and learning transfer. We discuss our study's implications for practice and for TMS and group learning theories.</p>
            <p>This article identifies gaps in the microfoundations of capabilities research, particularly in work that is based on the framework of evolutionary economics. It argues that such research has focused excessively on the quasi-automatic, routine-based aspects of capability development, and largely neglected the roles played by cognition and organizational hierarchy. By deriving a model of search that jointly considers how routine-based and cognitive logics of action coexist within an organizational hierarchy to affect capability development, this article offers three contributions. First, it delineates the traits of a microfoundational structure for research on capabilities that begins to address these gaps. Second, based on this structure, it highlights previously neglected causal mechanisms that contribute to our understanding of how capabilities develop. The model shows that managers' cognitive representations of their strategic decision problem fundamentally drive organizational search, and therefore the accumulation of capabilities. Furthermore, it shows that the accuracy of the representations a manager chooses might vary according to where she is situated in the organizational hierarchy. This more refined perspective leads to a set of propositions regarding how different hierarchical arrangements influence capability development and organizational performance. Finally, the paper sets an agenda for future research in this area.</p>
            <p>Once regarded as stable and inflexible, organizational routines are increasingly seen as capable of being adapted to the situation at hand and a potentially important source of endogenous change in organizations. This paper considers why routines that are performed flexibly may nonetheless persist over time. Drawing on data from participant observation of a high-tech manufacturing company, I identify factors that contribute to both the flexibility and persistence of a routine. First, individuals and groups approach routines with different intentions and orientations, suggesting that agency shapes particular routine performances. Second, routine performances are embedded in an organizational context that, while it may not restrict the flexible use of a routine, may constrain its ongoing adaptation. Finally, accounting for the relative power of individuals sheds light on the interaction between agency and context in routine performance and explains why the actions of some individuals, but not others, can change routines. This paper draws on recent work that conceptualizes routines as ongoing accomplishments, and it extends it by identifying how actors and contexts shape both individual performances of routines and contribute to their persistence or change over time.</p>
            <p>This paper augments learning and institutional theories of firm behavior with an explicit focus on the idiosyncratic characteristics of learning from financial markets. Various streams of literature implicitly assume that financial markets influence firm strategies, yet the specifics of these interactions are not well specified. Motivated by a case study of the retail brokerage industry, this study proposes three particular characteristics of learning from financial markets. First, there is vicarious learning from outcomes (e.g., stock valuations), yet this has characteristics that are more similar to institutional forms of mimetic isomorphism. Second, the forward-looking and complex nature of financial valuations incites a paradoxically simplified type of crude heuristic learning. Third, there is a mutual and simultaneous learning process in that firms learn from financial markets, which in turn are themselves in a process of social construction. This combination of special characteristics suggests a number of learning pathologies that center around an increasing likelihood (compared with other types of learning and adaptation) of falling prey to misleading signals. A computer simulation, based on a model in which Cournot duopolists play a multistage game involving investment and cost reduction, explores the implications of these characteristics and pathologies in a systematic way.</p>
            <p>Growing interest in knowledge as a competitive asset suggests the benefit of studying professional service firms (PSFs). These firms are highly successful examples of organizations whose ability to manage knowledge is critical to their success. Furthermore, they are worthy of study because they constitute a significant sector of the economy, whether measured by their size, numbers, or influence. Despite their significance, little is known of the determinants of their performance. This paper proposes that the core tasks of PSFs raise unusual strategic and organizational challenges, the resolution of which affects organizational performance. We elaborate the effects of reputation and diversification and contrast them to theory for goods-producing industries. We also hypothesize that PSF managers face a choice in designing structures between the retention and motivation of the professional workforce and transferring knowledge from partners to other professionals. These predictions are tested and supported by data from the largest 100 U.S. accounting firms for the period 1991-2000. The paper thus contributes to a theory of professional service firm management.</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for a specific form of intrafirm competition, namely the extent of overlap between the charters of two or more units in a single organization. This phenomenon is commonly seen in large organizations, e.g., cases of two business units producing competing products, or two product development groups trying to solve the same technological problem, but the existing academic literature provides little insight into the forms intrafirm competition takes, or the conditions under which it is beneficial or harmful to the organization. Building on the concept of an organization charter (Galunic and Eisenhardt 2001), we identify two generic forms of intrafirm competition: the dynamic community model has fluid and frequently changing charter boundaries, and it emerges through the creation of strategic options in the face of a changing environment; the coexistence model has fixed and relatively static charter boundaries, and it owes its existence to economies of scope and differentiation of unit charters to cover multiple market segments. In the body of the paper we develop a theoretical framework to specify the environmental and organizational conditions under which each form of intrafirm competition is expected to occur.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes that task interdependence in teams, usually treated solely as structurally driven, can arise from group members' values at the time of group formation. Findings from a longitudinal field study show that teams whose members share egalitarian values at formation develop highly interdependent task approaches and exhibit patterns of social interaction similar to those associated with high structural interdependence. By contrast, groups whose members share meritocratic values at formation develop low-interdependence task approaches and exhibit patterns of social interaction similar to those associated with low structural interdependence. Groups with shared hybrid or with mixed values show no consistent task structures or group processes, and significantly underperform relative to both the egalitarian and the meritocratic groups. We discuss the implications of these findings for the effectiveness of task-performing teams in organizations.</p>
            <p>Reputational rankings published by the media have emerged as important sources of institutional isomorphic pressures on organizations. However, organizations vary in the extent to which they respond to the pressures exerted by the rankings, and research to date has not examined why some organizations change in response to the rankings and others do not. This study develops and tests a model that examines how top managers' sensemaking of rankings affects organizational change. Specifically, the model proposes direct and moderated effects of a perceived discrepancy between the position assigned to an organization in the rankings and the position implied by the organization's identity in the minds of its top managers (referred to here as a "perceived identity-reputation discrepancy"), on the extent of change undertaken by the organization. The research context used for the study was U.S. graduate schools of business. The results show that, as expected, schools whose top managers believed that their rankings were discrepant from their own perceptions of their school's standing in the industry, were more likely to undertake organizational change. This relationship was moderated by top managers' perceptions of the strategic impact of the rankings, and by the strength and external orientation of organizational identity; the relationship was not moderated by the perceived validity of the rankings. Overall, the results suggest that managerial interpretations and organizational identity work in concert to explain variation across organizations in the extent to which rankings motivate organizational change.</p>
            <p>Temporary organizations are known to provide flexibility for industries that rely on them, but we know little about their implications for how work is accomplished and coordinated. In this paper, I propose that common portrayals of temporary organizations as ephemeral and unstable are inaccurate: Temporary organizations are in fact organized around structured role systems whose nuances are negotiated in situ. This paper analyzes one type of temporary organization, film projects, exploring the way in which roles both organize immediate work and maintain continuity across different projects. On each film set, role expectations are communicated through practices of enthusiastic thanking, polite admonishing, and role-oriented joking, which enable crew members to learn and negotiate role structures. Two important structural characteristics of film projects provide the organizational context within which coordination takes place: interorganizational career progression and projects as temporary total institutions. By showing how these structural elements and role enactments support one another, this work generates a more complete understanding of the conditions that affect coordination, including role duration, expectations of future interaction, and visibility of work.</p>
            <p>In our study of an interactive marketing organization, we examine how members of different communities perform boundary-spanning coordination work in conditions of high speed, uncertainty, and rapid change. We find that members engage in a number of cross-boundary coordination practices that make their work visible and legible to each other, and that enable ongoing revision and alignment. Drawing on the notion of a "trading zone," we suggest that by engaging in these practices, members enact a coordination structure that affords cross-boundary coordination while facilitating adaptability, speed, and learning. We also find that these coordination practices do not eliminate jurisdictional conflicts, and often generate problematic consequences such as the privileging of speed over quality, suppression of difference, loss of comprehension, misinterpretation and ambiguity, rework, and temporal pressure. After discussing our empirical findings, we explore their implications for organizations attempting to operate in the uncertain and rapidly changing contexts of postbureaucratic work.</p>
            <p>Studies of the sources of innovations have recognized that many innovations are developed by users. However, the fact that firms employ communities of users to strengthen their innovation process has not yet received much attention. In online firm-hosted user communities, users freely reveal innovations to a firm's product platform, which can put the firm in a favorable position (a) because these new product features become available to all users through sharing on a user-to-user basis, or (b) because it allows the firm to pick up the innovations and integrate them in future products and then benefit by selling them to all users. We study the key personal attributes of the individuals responsible for innovations, namely the innovative users, to explain creation of value in this organizational context. The main question is why such users contribute to firm-hosted user communities. Analyzing data derived from multiple sources (interviews, a Web-log, and questionnaires), we find that innovative users are likely to be (i) hobbyists, an attribute that can be assumed to (positively) affect innovators' willingness to share innovations, and (ii) responsive to "firm recognition" as a motivating factor for undertaking innovation, which explains their decision to join the firm's domain. In agreement with earlier studies, we also find that innovative users are likely to be "lead users," an attribute that we assume to affect the quality of user innovation. Whether or not a firm-hosted user community can be turned into an asset for the firm is to a great extent conditional on the issues studied in this paper.</p>
            <p>This paper uses data from the sales division of a financial services firm to investigate how a leader's centrality in external and internal social networks is related to the objective performance of the leader's group, and to the leader's personal reputation for leadership among subordinates, peers, and supervisors. External social network ties were based on the friendship ties among all 88 of the division's sales group leaders and the 10 high-ranking supervisors to whom they reported. Internal social network ties consisted of 28 separate networks, each representing the set of friendship relations among all members of a given sales group. Objective group performance data came directly from company records. Data on each group leader's personal reputation for leadership was based on the perceptions of three different constituencies: subordinates, peers, and supervisors. Results revealed that leaders' centrality in external and internal friendship networks was related both to objective measures of group performance and to their reputation for leadership among different organizational constituencies.</p>
            <p>This paper introduces and empirically explores the concept of an organizational reference group: the set of people an individual perceives as belonging to his or her work environment that defines the social world of work in which he or she engages. The concept is proposed to fill a gap in studies of social context. Scholars tend only to infer, not identify, the people an individual is aware of at work. This surmise creates no problem in groups or small organizations where everyone knows everyone else. However, it becomes troublesome in large organizations where the set of people one individual discerns may vary considerably from that of another. Social network studies of large organizations examine people an individual perceives, but focus on interpersonal communication through salient relationships. They tend to neglect the many distant others who populate an individual's social context: those known only through company newsletters or office gossip, those with whom the individual never has contact, and those who carry little immediate salience. Data from a large organization are used to explore whether organizational reference groups provide distinct, useful information about individuals' perceptions of their social context at work. The findings replicate those showing individuals' preferences for similar others, but also note previously unobserved systematic differences in the composition of close associations compared to the broader ones of organizational reference groups. Distant associations are considerably more homogeneous than close ones. Moreover, the results show that organizational reference groups illuminate career referent selection and expected achievement beyond what would be learned from a typical social network analysis.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore opposing theoretical claims about how organizational reputation affects market reactions to product defects. On the one hand, good reputation could be a disadvantage because expectations about product quality are more likely to be violated by defects in highly reputed products. On the other hand, a good reputation could be an advantage because of strong inertial effects on reputation orderings. We empirically test these competing hypotheses using data on product recalls in the U.S. automobile industry from 1975 to 1999. Our results support for the idea that reputation can be an organizational liability in that highly reputed firms suffer more market penalty as a result of their product recalls. We also propose that the reputational effects are moderated by two important factors: substitutability and generalism/specialism. Our results show that having few substitutes with an equivalent level of reputation, or a focused product identity stemming from specialism, buffers the negative market reactions to product recalls. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of these results for institutional, reputation, and status theories.</p>
            <p>A key question for organizational learning research is to identify opportunities and constraints for firms to gain useful information from the activities and performance of other firms. We argue that market-level turnover events generate and release vicarious information that small multiunit organizations can use to enhance their likelihood of survival. We focus on two specific turnover events, ownership transfers and contemporaneous exit-entry pairs (cases in which both outlet entry and outlet exit occur within the same market within the same time period), because these events are likely to generate and release information without altering the total number of outlets in a market. We find that the likelihood of a multiunit owner's outlet exit declines when there are many ownership transfers and exit-entry pairs in other markets where the owner also operates outlets. We conclude that these turnover events, even in just one market where a small multiunit organization is present, generate vicarious information substantial enough to increase the survival likelihood of all outlets of that multiunit organization. Our theory and supporting results show how organizational learning-based arguments can be combined with our knowledge of multiunit organizations to build a theory of relationships between geographically separated turnover events.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the relationship between authoring of identities and organizational development through a case study of the 18-year history of a professional service firm. Drawing from process theory, narrative psychology, and practice approaches to identity, I outline a perspective on organizational becoming as dialogic imagination of practice. Conceived as such, authoring takes place as a continuous stream of suggestions of what practice is, has been, and could be, simultaneously addressing life enrichment and organizational development. Three forms of imagination of practice are identified as central in the development of the case organization: (1) the instantiating of project experiences as identity exemplars; (2) a powerful dramatizing of trajectories of practice, exemplified by use of the metaphor of the "Indomitable Gauls;" and (3) a subsequent reframing instigated by discontinuous changes in dominant activity sets. The three authoring forms are discussed in relation to organizational development and adaptation. Implications include increased attention to forward-looking authoring motives and hope, a reformulation of the identity question from "who are we?" to "what are we doing?" and a possible location of practices as belonging to stories beyond that of the organization.</p>
            <p>Opportunities associated with discontinuous change typically do not trigger organizational response until the opportunity is perceived as a threat. However, threat perception can then trigger a response that accentuates organizational rigidity. This cognitive paradox is explored using a multilevel, longitudinal case study of a newspaper organization's response to digital publishing. The results suggest that the competing frames of threat and opportunity can coexist within the firm when it creates organizationally differentiated subunits. Such a structure minimizes the need to integrate competing frames at the subunit level, enabling different behaviors to be enacted simultaneously across different units of the firm. This differentiated organizational form places an increased burden on senior teams that have to manage the inconsistencies across subunits. Insight into the structure of competing frames has broader implications for the structure of dynamic capabilities.</p>
            <p>The academic focus of organization studies has unfortunately drifted over the years from the issues that organizations pose for their members and their societies, and the issues that confront people who seek to improve organizations. However, studies of efforts to design organizations can help us to better understand organizations and may also help us to improve them. The papers in this special issue of Organization Science describe several specific efforts to design organizations, telling why people wanted to make changes and what happened when people sought to make them.</p>
            <p>Design rules allocate functions to modules, identify operating principles, and set interfaces among modules that determine how organizations evolve. A case study of radical innovation in tire manufacturing illustrates the transition from old to new design rules through the joint adaptation of the manufacturing organization and the product to reflect changes in the underlying engineering knowledge. The case shows how knowledge evolution mediates organizational and technological change and makes any organization design openended and evolving.</p>
            <p>This paper details a longitudinal interpretative field study of an information technology (IT) organization in which a new chief information officer (CIO) implemented a major organizational redesign. The redesign increased the degree of codification in activities of the IT organization so as to control, coordinate, and deliver services more cost effectively to its business clients. We examine different stakeholders' views of the change, the implementation processes, and the consequences of the redesign. The case analysis emphasizes specific challenges that designers of support organizations face when increasing the degree of codification. Key implications include the need for these designers to (1) pay as much, if not more, attention to the local organizational context as they do to the external environmental conditions; (2) communicate and negotiate constantly with various stakeholders concerning the appropriate degree of codification and control; (3) be wary of how a strict alignment of all design elements can blind the designer to important, unrecognized issues; and (4) consider that increased codification may help support organizations compete more efficiently with external vendors, but may also ease the process of outsourcing.</p>
            <p>The challenge for NASA's Systems Analysis Integrated Discipline Team (SAIDT) is to develop a new organization design capable of performing complex modeling and analysis tasks, using team members at various NASA centers. The focus is on: (1) design as a process, (2) the effect of design tools on the process as well as alternative designs, (3) the fit between the tools and their fit with the organization, (4) the effect of an ongoing agencywide transformation, and (5) implications for organizational contingency theory.</p>
            <p>Organization design in its verb form is explored through a study of the design practices of a major contemporary architect, Frank O. Gehry, and his firm, Gehry Partners, LLP. Through four case studies, we explore how the organization design of his architectural projects is an outcome of Gehry Partner's design gestalt. We argue that this design gestalt is a primary source of their organization designing and is composed of an architectural vision, the tight coupling of multiple representation technologies, and a commitment to a collaborative process of design and construction. These elements of design together form a holistic, organizing pattern-their design gestalt-that is evident in all of Gehry Partners projects, both their buildings and their organizational forms. We offer three characteristics of organization designing-focus on form giving, relation to environment, and temporality. We argue that developing a design gestalt and strengthening the capacity for organization designing is crucial for firms in our increasingly knowledge- and experience-based economy.</p>
            <p>Differing bases of competition in early and later stages of an innovation's life cycle call for differing organization designs. Designs that fit early strategic contingencies tend to misfit later ones. Over time, innovating units must either minimize the negative effects of misfit, or make difficult changes in design. Using four paired case studies, we examine how firms address conflicts in strategic contingencies, how managers adjust to misfits, and how organizations adapt their designs. We find that firms use one of three adaptation modes, none of which is fully autonomous nor fully integrated, and all of which change over time. Each mode optimizes for one contingency while suboptimally attempting to address the other. The study suggests practical insights for researchers and managers.</p>
            <p>Often, researchers study organizations in which design is largely in place and the design process is shrouded in the distant past. However, the design process can have dramatic implications for how organizations function. This paper reports a specific attempt to design one organizational subunit, a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), to function under difficult circumstances. The founders aimed to create a highly reliable and safe unit, but implementing their vision required continuous effort. The unit needed constant buffering from external pressures and a dissimilar parent organization, and these forces shaped the unit's ultimate design. Through the presentation of this case, we discuss the impact of design on the organization, its members, and the larger hospital organization to which the unit belonged. The study reveals that the PICU's design was an ongoing effort and its most stable component was a vision of distributed knowledge and decentralized intensive care. We conclude by discussing implications of the case for organizational design theory and practice.</p>
            <p>The concept of "vertical architecture" defines the scope of a firm and the extent to which it is open to final and intermediate markets; it describes the configurations of transactional choices along a firm's value chain. A firm can make or buy inputs, and transfer outputs downstream or sell them. Permeable vertical architectures are partly integrated and partly open to the markets along a firm's value chain. Increased permeability enables more effective use of resources and capacities, better matching of capabilities with market needs, and benchmarking to improve efficiency. Partial integration promotes a more dynamic, open innovation platform and enhances strategic capabilities by linking key parts of the value chain. This permeable vertical architecture, accompanied by appropriate transfer prices and incentive design, facilitates resource allocation and guides a firm's growth process. Our longitudinal study of a major European manufacturer suggests that to understand how firm boundaries are set and what their impacts are, we need to complement the microanalytic focus on transactions with a systemic analysis at the level of the firm. It also shows how, over and above transactional alignment, decisions about boundaries and vertical architectures can transform a firm's strategic and productive capabilities and prospects.</p>
            <p>Design thinking has long tried to join form, function, and aesthetic appeal. In cars, furniture, architecture, typography, clothes, or photography, good designs regularly solve problems of movement, massing, and balance in attractive and inspiring ways. The field of organization design is comparatively young in this regard, having mostly focused on questions of efficiency and expendiency rather than aesthetics; nevertheless, designers are increasingly being called on to create organizations that "sing" rather than just "work." Here, we consider how aesthetically sophisticated design thinking from the arts might be applied in organizational design. Specifically, we consider the case of Learning Lab Denmark-a research institute that has experimented extensively with aesthetically informed organizational design-in light of the mobile art of Alexander Calder and other constructivist artists who championed flexible design. We conclude that in such organizations, (1) designers must strike an ongoing, interactive balance between centric and acentric design orientations and practices, (2) aesthetic consideration is fundamentally important when it comes to crafting effective design, and (3) designing processes should be given as much attention as design solutions.</p>
            <p>We explore how organizations may be designed to transform themselves even as they continue to perform seamlessly on a day-to-day basis. Our inquiry frame recognizes that organizational designs comprise several elements-people, technologies, processes, and governance. Our study of an exemplary organization, Infosys Technologies, yields two insights. At Infosys, each design element is seeded with generative properties. As these design elements interact, reinforcing and balancing one another, an overall organizational platform of resources, capabilities, and options emerges. The company draws on this emergent platform to perform in real time even as it transforms itself to adapt to changing environments.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes science-based organization design that uses construction principles and design rules to guide practitioner-academic projects. Organization science implies construction principles for creating and implementing designs. These principles serve to construct design rules that are instrumental in developing organization designs. Testing and implementing designs require pragmatic experimentation in complex, dynamic settings. The authors explore a circular design process as an example of science-based organization design. Tests of this circular process in over 30 organizations suggest that construction principles are important for creating new design rules as well as for a deeper understanding of the systems and practices created from these rules. In addition, explicit principles and rules for organization design appear to facilitate the transfer of learning between different projects. As such, they can help reconnect organization research to ongoing design work.</p>
            <p>School districts have made several attempts at decentralizing. However, decentralization in school districts can mean so many different things that the term has nearly lost its meaning. This paper reports a study of three large urban school districts that, over almost 30 years, adopted nearly identical approaches to decentralizing, granting control to principals and expanding freedom of choice for families. In all three cases, the goal of improving student achievement was achieved, although with a very small sample. These three districts are compared to the three largest public districts in North America. The comparisons reveal that the three decentralized districts attained a high level of principal control over school budgets, staffing, schedule, and teaching methods.</p>
            <p>Organizational communities present two generic features that are recurrently documented in empirical studies, but only imperfectly accounted for in current models of interorganizational relations. The first is the tendency of participant organizations to construct observed macrostructure locally, through relational activities that involve only a small subset of possible network ties. The second is the tendency for different types of ties to overlap, concatenate, and induce a variety of local structures-or relational motifs-across network domains. A critical task in the analysis of organizational communities is to specify appropriate local dependence structures across multiple networks, starting from detailed observation of dyadic interaction among participants. In this paper we illustrate one way in which this analytical task might be accomplished in the context of a study of interorganizational networks. We use data that we have collected on different types of relationships among 106 organizations, located in Southern Italy, involved in the production of means of transportation to test hypotheses about patterns of local network ties and paths across multiple networks. Our empirical analysis is guided by the general claim that the formation of network ties is subject to endogenous and exogenous processes. We specify statistical models for random graphs that allow us to examine this claim, and to formulate and test specific hypotheses about the form that such network-based processes might take. The results that we report provide clear empirical support for the relational motifs implied by our hypotheses. We also find strong empirical support for the proposition that interorganizational dependencies extend across multiple networks.</p>
            <p>We identify which types of ties best distinguish pairs of Chilean firms in the same business group from pairs of Chilean firms that are not group brethren. Overlap in owners, indirect equity holdings, and director interlocks are especially strong delineators of group boundaries. Family connections and direct equity holdings do not do as good a job of distinguishing group boundaries. These findings challenge the longstanding conventional wisdom among field-based scholars that family bonds are the defining feature of business groups in emerging markets. We speculate that family bonds are so durable that, over time, they come to pervade the entirety of an economy and lose their ability to distinguish business groups from the overall network of social and economic ties. Our techniques to identify business groups may apply to research on other types of groups-interpersonal and interorganizational-in which ties among actors are multiplex, ties are only partly observed, and group definitions are socially constructed.</p>
            <p>In this paper we examine social capital and its relationship with performance at the organizational level. We predict that both internal and external social capital will have a positive effect on organizational performance. We test our hypotheses in 88 urban public schools where we collected data from principals, teachers, parents, and students. Results indicate that both internal social capital (relations among teachers) and external social capital (relations between the principal and external stakeholders) predict student achievement in mathematics and reading. These effects were sustained over time for reading achievement, providing support for a causal relationship between social capital and performance. We provide evidence that social capital's impact on student achievement in math-but not reading-is mediated by the quality of instruction provided by teachers. These results underscore the importance of context in studies of social capital.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the roles of cosmopolitans and locals in transnational teams that work on knowledge-intensive projects. I propose that cosmopolitan and local team members can help their teams to acquire and apply knowledge more effectively, by bringing both internal and external knowledge to their teams and enabling the teams to more successfully transform this knowledge into improved project performance. Findings from a study of 96 project teams at an international development agency reveal that the roles of cosmopolitans and locals were complex and sometimes valuable, but that cosmopolitans offered greater benefits than locals. The study also revealed that too many of each could hurt. Implications for theory and research on international management, virtual teams, exploration and exploitation, and organizational knowledge are discussed.</p>
            <p>The organizing stages that predate entry into an organizational population were studied from an ecological perspective. Based on a detailed analysis of foreign banks in Shanghai, findings are presented that suggest that the likelihood of moving from the organizing phase to the operational stages is nonmonotonically dependent on the length of the waiting time. We found that firms seeking to gain entry into a population are negatively affected by the presence of other organizers in close geographical proximity, while the number of already-established organizations has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the aspirant's likelihood of entering a relationship that operates more broadly. After investigating the effect of the geographical location of other potential entrants, as well as the effect of relative sizes and countries of origin, we have drawn inferences about the strength of these competitors' identities and their impact on a social actor's decision to enter the population. Our findings are informative not only for those studying organizational founding patterns, but also for those interested in the early process of identity formation.</p>
            <p>With globalization and the growth in emerging economies, multinational enterprises (MNEs) now frequently confront challenges associated with corrupt governments. Already, a growing body of research has demonstrated that corruption significantly reduces a country's aggregate inflows of foreign direct investment through its effects on firm performance. We move the analysis of corruption from aggregate financial flows toward managerial theory and practice by examining how firms adjust their strategy for entering foreign markets in corrupt environments and how different types of corruption affect firms' choices. Building on institutional theory, we predict that MNEs will respond to pervasive and arbitrary corruption in a host country by selecting particular types of equity and nonequity modes of entry. Using data on 220 telecommunications development projects in 64 emerging economies, we find that firms adapt to the pressures of corruption via short-term contracting and entry into joint ventures. We also find that the arbitrariness surrounding corrupt transactions has a significant impact on firms' decisions, in addition to the overall level of corruption. In contrast to extant research, we show that MNEs use nonequity-entry modes or partnering as an adaptive strategy to participate in markets despite the presence of corruption.</p>
            <p>An ethnographic study of a team of software developers working on a new product across two groups-located on the West Coast of the United States and in Bangalore, India-is used to analyze status dynamics in distributed groups. Whereas existing literature has emphasized the importance of communication, task design, and incentives for cooperation, this paper shows how status differentials and geographic distance reinforce each other to affect the work processes and collaboration in distributed teams. The focus is on two elements: the relationship between the collaboration across the two groups and their members and the members' interpretations of this relationship. Status influences the perceptions of the remote group, as well as the willingness to cooperate with its members. The key findings specify the informal closure strategies used by the high-status group in relation to the low-status group. Furthermore, the superimposition of geographic and status distance in remote work lowered the cost of exclusion of one group from the collaboration and led to the deepening of status differences between remote groups. By showing status to be both an input and an output of intergroup relations, the paper specifies some of the mechanisms through which status orderings are maintained and reinforced.</p>
            <p>The paper examines the significance of enforceability and adaptability in governing vertical alliances and their performance ramifications for suppliers. Literature on supplier relations suggests that suppliers are skeptical of close ties with their buyers (Helper 1991, Helper and Sako 1995). Such skepticism persists in spite of the fact that buyers are writing longer (enforceable) contracts with fewer suppliers. In this context, the paper develops a transaction cost economics (TCE)-based model that distinguishes between the verifiable and nonverifiable aspects of governance attributes (of safeguards, incentive intensity, and adaptability) in explaining supplier performance variations. The paper argues that the following factors prove valuable for suppliers: (1) the adaptive and collaborative orientation fostered by the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM's) credible commitment to the exchange and by information sharing on the part of the supplier, (2) the presence of certain nonverifiable safeguards, and (3) the incentives inherent in target pricing. These assertions have been tested using data from the home appliance industry. Results indicate that information sharing together with (1) OEM dependence and (2) target pricing does indeed enhance supplier performance. Also, results suggest that while nonverifiable safeguards can help, verifiable safeguards do not have a positive association with supplier interests. Under certain conditions then, suppliers can venture into closer relationships with buyers and benefit.</p>
            <p>We integrate the upper-echelons perspective with the attention-based view of the firm by examining the role of attentional orientation of top management teams (TMTs). In the context of airline deregulation, we find that deregulation caused a shift in managerial attention, but that this shift in attention was the greatest for firms that changed the composition and compensation of their TMTs in ways that favored the deregulated regime. We also find that attention partially mediated the relationship between TMT changes and strategy changes. The results of this study shed light on the transformation of industry attention patterns following an environmental shift, and the role of TMT composition and incentive systems in that process.</p>
            <p>We propose that organizations use a new framework of workday design to enhance the creativity of today's chronically overworked professionals. Although insights from creativity research have been integrated into models of work design to increase the stimulants of creativity (e.g., intrinsic motivation), this has not led to work design models that have effectively reduced the obstacles to creativity (e.g., workload pressures). As a consequence, creative output among professionals in high-workload contexts remains disappointing. In response, we offer a framework of work design that focuses on the design of entire workdays rather than the typical focus on designing either specific tasks or very broad job descriptions (e.g., as the job characteristics model in Hackman et al. 1975). Furthermore, we introduce the concept of "mindless" work (i.e., work that is low in both cognitive difficulty and performance pressures) as an integral part of this framework. We suggest that to enhance creativity among chronically overworked professionals, workdays should be designed to alternate between bouts of cognitively challenging and high-pressure work (as suggested in the original model by Hackman et al. 1975), and bouts of mindless work (as defined in this paper). We discuss the implications of our framework for theories of work design and creativity.</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a model of collective creativity that explains how the locus of creative problem solving shifts, at times, from the individual to the interactions of a collective. The model is grounded in observations, interviews, informal conversations, and archival data gathered in intensive field studies of work in professional service firms. The evidence suggests that although some creative solutions can be seen as the products of individual insight, others should be regarded as the products of a momentary collective process. Such collective creativity reflects a qualitative shift in the nature of the creative process, as the comprehension of a problematic situation and the generation of creative solutions draw from-and reframe-the past experiences of participants in ways that lead to new and valuable insights. This research investigates the origins of such moments, and builds a model of collective creativity that identifies the precipitating roles played by four types of social interaction: help seeking, help giving, reflective reframing, and reinforcing. Implications of this research include shifting the emphasis in research and management of creativity from identifying and managing creative individuals to understanding the social context and developing interactive approaches to creativity, and from a focus on relatively constant contextual variables to the alignment of fluctuating variables and their precipitation of momentary phenomena.</p>
            <p>An important new stream of organizational research has emerged in recent years that draws on the notion of mindfulness. At the same time, there is a long-standing body of work in the organizations literature that emphasizes the role of routine-driven, or less-mindful, behavior. We attempt to connect these two seemingly disparate literatures arguing that, at a performative level, important elements of less-mindful processes are necessary elements underlying mindfulness. In particular, we note the role of established action repertories that facilitate the response to novel stimuli and how routines and established role structures enable mindfulness to be sustained across time and the span of the organization. Similarly, we note important elements of mindfulness that underlie less-mindful behavior, highlighting in particular the role of mindfulness in interpreting one's context so as to identify what constitutes appropriate action in a given circumstance and in interpreting outcomes that form the basis for processes of reinforcement learning. Although we emphasize the complementarity between the two perspectives, we also note points of tension regarding the opportunity costs of mindfulness and the theories' implied normative claims.</p>
            <p>Mindfulness as depicted by Levinthal and Rerup (2006) involves encoding ambiguous outcomes in ways that influence learning, and encoding stimuli in ways that match context with a repertoire of routines. We add to Levinthal and Rerup's conjectures by examining Western and Eastern versions of mindfulness and how they function as a process of knowing an object. In our expanded view, encoding becomes less central. What becomes more central are activities such as altering the codes, differentiating the codes, introspecting the coding process itself, and, most of all, reducing the overall dependence on coding and codes. Consequently, we shift from Levinthal and Rerup's contrast between mindful and less mindful to a contrast between conceptual and less conceptual. When people move away from conceptuality and encoding, outcomes are affected more by the quality than by the quantity of attention.</p>
            <p>In this study we propose that norms of fairness are salient to top decision makers and show that over- or underpayment of the CEO cascades down to lower organizational levels. Moreover, it appears that CEOs use their own power not only to increase their own salaries, but also those of their subordinates. One implication of such a process may be that the overpayment of a top executive has higher costs than have previously been realized. We also find evidence suggesting that CEOs serve as a key referent for employees in determining whether their own situation is "fair," and this influences their reactions to their own compensation. More specifically, we find that when lower-level managers are underpaid relative to the CEO-that is, underpaid more than the CEO or overpaid less-they are more likely to leave the organization. Results obtained from testing our hypotheses on a sample of more than 120 firms over a five-year period demonstrates the importance of considering fairness in the setting of CEO pay. Implications for the design of executive compensation packages are discussed.</p>
            <p>Acquisition integration is a pivotal factor in determining whether the objectives of an acquisition are achieved. In this paper, we hypothesize that the productivity of corporate scientists of acquired companies is generally impaired by integration, but that some scientists experience more disruption than others. In particular, acquisition integration will be most disruptive, leading to the most severe productivity drops, for those inventors who have lost the most social status and centrality in the combined entity. Drawing from prior literatures on the knowledge-based view of the firm, and on mergers and acquisitions, we develop hypotheses about a concise set of conditions that will lead to substantial performance drops for acquired technical personnel. We test our hypotheses, using patent application data, on a sample of 3,933 inventors in pharmaceutical firms whose companies were acquired. Results are strongly in line with our theorized expectations.</p>
            <p>Prior reviews of the CEO turnover and succession literature suggest that empirical findings on organizational implications continue to be equivocal. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework for examining the impact of CEO turnover and succession on organizational capabilities. Using the social network perspective as a theoretical lens, we identify conditions in which CEO turnover is expected to influence organizational exploration and exploitation capabilities. We also identify contingencies under which CEO succession will moderate the impact of CEO turnover on organizational capabilities. Our framework provides a useful lens through which to view the consequences of CEO turnover and succession and sheds some light on the equivocal findings to date.</p>
            <p>We know that organizations of different but related kinds greatly influence each other's evolution. Although empirical findings abound, the theories behind them are still being developed. We advance a model of ecological interdependence between emergent and established populations. Our model is based on three main ideas. First, we consider related populations to be those that overlap in identity and resource space and that simultaneously exhibit competitive and mutualistic relationships, the latter leading to legitimacy transfer. Second, we build on the idea that legitimated forms codify prescriptive sanctions for deviations from identity blueprints, and predict that when an emergent population overlaps with an established one in identity space, its early proliferation will manifest violations of established social identities and will trigger prescriptive sanctions. Third, we rely on the notion of a focused identity to argue that organization-level changes affect external perceptions of the population's collective identity, and hamper legitimacy. Analysis of the survival rates of financial cooperatives in Singapore-a population overlapping the identity and resources of commercial banks-confirms our predictions.</p>
            <p>Organizations are occasionally faced with technology-based and accident-triggered crises that may cause costly disasters if not handled properly. Questions arise: How should organizations, with their complex processes and human involvement, be designed if they are to perform well in such crises? Would organizations benefit from structural changes during crises? From a neo-information processing perspective that views organizations as composed of cognitively restricted, socially situated, and task-oriented actors, we argue that the causes and consequences of crises may be better understood through the systematic examination of both environmental and organizational factors. We address our research questions using a rather unique approach: a matched analysis of 80 real organizational cases and 80 computer-simulated organizations. The findings show that a crisis can present critical challenges to organizational performance both externally and internally, and that there is no design guarantee that a high-performing organization will continue to perform well during a crisis situation. In addition, when organizations restructure to adapt to crisis situations, they often face the serious challenges of having to understand not only the external environment, but also organizational design traps.</p>
            <p>Ashforth and Kreiner (1999) documented how workers in so-called "dirty work" occupations were able to overcome threats to their social identities by engaging in the cognitive tactics of ideology manipulation and social weighting. This paper expands Ashforth and Kreiner's work in three ways. First, we move beyond an exclusive focus on intense dirty work occupations by mapping the broader landscape of stigmatized work. Second, we examine how system justification theory and social identity theory-typically cast as competing mechanisms by which individuals and groups perceive their places in a social structure-can complement each other to tell a more complete story of how individuals and groups deal with stigmatized identities. Third, we consider how stigmatized workers experience identification, disidentification, and ambivalence as a result of conflicting occupational and societal influences.</p>
            <p>Using a comparative institutional perspective, we explore whether business groups' roles in facilitating affiliate firms' innovation varies by country and time period. We compare the innovativeness of firms affiliated with business groups to that of independent firms in two emerging economies: South Korea and Taiwan. On average, business group affiliates outperform independent firms in South Korea, but not in Taiwan, and in the early 1990s, but not in the late 1990s. The existence of alternative institutional infrastructures for innovation might explain these differences. Groups' abilities to share technological knowledge and financial resources among affiliates enables them to create value by promoting innovation in emerging economies, but groups' diversification might inhibit individual affiliates' innovativeness.</p>
            <p>We believe that the field of organization theory is adrift. In sailing jargon, we are "in irons"-stalled and making little headway toward understanding organizations and their place in our lives. We first attempt to diagnose our maladies and then, in this light, offer three broad research questions that just might reinvigorate our work: First, how can we understand today's changing organizations? Second, how can we live in these organizations? And third, how can we best live with them? We close by calling attention to how our familiar approaches to building and testing theory might hamper any attempt to revitalize our field.</p>
            <p>An emerging body of institutional scholarship emphasizes the role played by private decentralized institutions in facilitating collective action among organizations. However, these institutions often suffer from free riding and opportunism. This may lead firms to exit the institution and eventually cause its collapse. In this paper, we explore how private decentralized institutions may be sustained despite these problems. We focus on one form of private decentralized institution-trade association-sponsored industry self-regulatory programs. We advance two alternative hypotheses to explain the sustained existence of industry self-regulatory institutions: (a) Firms participate to gain a participation-contingent benefit, and (b) firms participate to maintain a generally beneficial institution. Using a 10-year panel of data from the chemical industry, we find evidence consistent with the latter hypothesis for at least one prominent example of self-regulation. Our findings have implications for both specific models of industry self-regulation and general theories of collective action.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the competitive consequences of interfirm mobility. Because the loss of key members (defined as top decision makers) to competing firms may amount to a replication of a firm's higher-order routines, we investigate the conditions under which interfirm mobility triggers transfer of routines across organizational boundaries. We examine membership lists pertinent to the Dutch accounting industry to study key member exits and firm dissolutions over the period 1880-1986. We exploit information on the type of membership migration (individual versus collective) and the competitive saliency of the destination firm as inferred from the recipient status (incumbent versus start-up) and its geographic location (same versus different province). The dissolution risk is highest when collective interfirm mobility results in a new venture within the same geographic area. The theoretical implications of this study are discussed.</p>
            <p>Although the existing theory predicts that a referral's chances of being hired increase with the job performance of the referrer, no empirical evidence is available to support this claim. To address this discrepancy, we decompose the recruitment process into objective selection, subjective selection, and self-selection and theorize that the likelihood of passing a particular recruitment stage increases with the performance of the referrer under objective selection and self-selection, but remains undetermined at a stage of subjective selection. Our analysis of unique comprehensive data on online recruitment of sales agents in a virtual call center supports these arguments. The effectiveness of personnel as a recruitment channel varies with the type of the recruitment stage and performance of the referrer. When the firm evaluates candidates by an objective criterion, the advantage of a referral increases with the performance of his or her referrer; those referred by relatively high-performing workers are significantly better than the applicants who learned about the job from Internet ads. When job candidates self-select into the next stage of the online application process, the referral of any agent is more likely to continue than a nonreferral, and this likelihood increases with the performance of the referrer. On a subjective stage, the outcome is contingent on the intricacies of the recruitment process. In our case, an applicant's chances of being hired increase with the performance of his or her referrer because the firm rejects the referrals of low-performing workers at a higher rate than it does nonreferrals, while it treats equally the referrals of high-performing workers and nonreferrals. The study's contributions to the literature on social networks in labor markets are discussed.</p>
            <p>Our study investigates the antecedents and performance implications of cooperative exchange norms. We argue that, in early relationships, the level of expected cooperative norms in an exchange is the result of a calculative process facilitated by transaction attributes: joint transaction-specific investments and observability. The greater the level of these two exchange attributes, the greater the level of cooperative exchange norms, all else being equal. We further argue that the realized level of cooperative exchange norms can deviate from the expected level because the development of such norms is the result of social processes that management cannot directly and fully control. This gap between realized and expected norms affects exchange performance. Performance suffers when the realized level of cooperative exchange norms falls below the expected level, but overshooting expectations lays a critical groundwork for repeat transactions. The analysis of a survey of 182 collaborative R&amp;D alliances provides initial support for our theory.</p>
            <p>This study examines how the organizational success of 113 nonprofit professional theatres was affected when two top leaders responsible for different parts of the organization held divergent views about organizational identity. Focusing on five values that differentiate theatres, we find that leaders' disagreement about organizational identity was related to lower ticket revenues and lower net income, and that organizational performance was lowest when disagreement about identity was extreme. Although some findings suggest that minor identity disagreement between leaders may not hurt organizations, results generally support the perspective that leaders should actively promote a single identity.</p>
            <p>Gresov and Drazin's (1997) suggestions regarding the study of equifinality are used to investigate the organizational configurations that exists within a suboptimal equifinality context. A suboptimal equifinality situation exists when organizations must satisfy multiple and conflicting functional demands with a restricted set of design options; these restrictions force all organizations to operate suboptimally. Gresov and Drazin (1997) speculate that in such a situation legitimacy claims are made about one function being more important than the other(s) so that an increased quantity of acceptable organizational forms are established. Additionally, they argue that a misfit penalty is likely to exist for organizations that deviate from the preferred configurational design. With data from the medical group industry, these speculations about suboptimal equifinality situations are tested using multivariate regression analyses. Findings show that the configuration type aligning with the preferred functional demand of quality performs relatively higher than those aligning with operational efficiency or attempting to meet both demands. Additionally, the greater the organization's deviation from that design, the lower the financial performance. In summary, this study demonstrates that it is useful to take a functional equivalence perspective when examining variance in firm performance that is caused by design differences. Such an approach allows a more complete understanding of the fit-performance relationship by explicitly considering three factors: (i) the number of and level of conflict(s) among functional demands placed on the organization, (ii) the structural design options available to the decision maker, and (iii) the trade-offs that exist.</p>
            <p>The paper examined the effects of nonprofit organizations' network ties over time on growth. Donative nonprofits, which relied heavily on contributions and volunteers, grew at a faster rate if they had high status, more ties to urban elites, and greater interorganizational network centrality. In contrast, commercial nonprofits, which depended on fees and/or sales and employees, grew at faster rates if they had fewer ties to other nonprofits and local elites. Also, as nonprofits became more dependent on fees and/or sales, they moved to the periphery of the interorganizational resource exchange network. The findings contribute to the social capital literature by suggesting that networks are more beneficial to organizations that depend on donations and gifts than on earned income.</p>

            <p>Combining insights from organizational ecology and social network theory, we examine how the structure of relations among organizational populations affects differences in rates of foundings across geographic locales. We hypothesize that symbiotic and commensalistic interpopulation relations function as channels of information about entrepreneurial opportunities and that differing access to such information influences the founding rate. Empirical analyses of U.S. instruments manufacturers support this argument. The founding rate of instruments manufacturers rises with the densities of organizational populations that have symbiotic and commensalistic relationships with instruments manufacturers. These factors encourage the initial foundings of instruments manufacturers in areas where such organizations were not previously found. The dominance of organizational populations tied to instruments manufacturing by symbiotic or commensalistic relations increases the rate of foundings of instruments manufacturers, whereas the dominance of organizational populations that lack these relations decreases it. Finally, we find that interpopulation relationships that hinge on direct contact have less impact on initial foundings as geographic distance increases. These results have implications for research on organizational ecology, entrepreneurship, urban sociology, and economic geography.</p>
            <p>Through analyses of audience reception of U.S.-produced feature film projects from the period 2000-2003, I develop insight into the trade-off assumed in organizational ecology theory between an organization's niche width and its fitness. This assumption, termed the principle of allocation, holds that the greater the diversity in regions of resource space targeted by an organization, the lower the organization's capacity to perform well within them. Using data at both the professional critic and consumer levels, I demonstrate the empirical validity of this principle: films targeting more genres attract larger audiences but are less appealing to those audience members. Moreover, I find that audiences' perceptions of a film's fit with targeted genres drive this trade-off, as multi-genre films are difficult for audiences to make sense of, leading to poor fit with tastes and lowered appeal. These findings highlight the key role audiences' perceptions play in the trade-offs associated with different niche strategies.</p>

            <p>To understand why the virtual design strategies that organizations create to foster innovation may in fact hinder it, we unpack four characteristics often associated with the term "virtuality" (geographic dispersion, electronic dependence, structural dynamism, and national diversity) and argue that each hinders innovation through unique mechanisms, many of which can be overcome by creating a psychologically safe communication climate. We first tested the plausibility of our arguments using indepth qualitative analysis of interviews with 177 members of 14 teams in a variety of industries. A second study constituted a more formal test of hypotheses using survey data collected from 266 members of 56 aerospace design teams. Results show that the four characteristics are not highly intercorrelated, that they have independent and differential effects on innovation, and that a psychologically safe communication climate helps mitigate the challenges they pose. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and research.</p>
            <p>Empirical research has typically rested on the assumption that board independence from management enhances board effectiveness in administering firms. The present study shows how and when a lack of social independence can increase board involvement and firm performance by raising the frequency of advice and counsel interactions between CEOs and outside directors. Hypotheses were tested with original survey data from 243 CEOs and 564 outside directors on behavioral processes and dynamics in management-board relationships.</p>

            <p>Pay distribution research is relatively scarce in the compensation literature, yet pay distributions are viewed as critically important by organizational decision makers. This study is a direct test of the relationship between one form of pay distribution--pay dispersion--and performance conducted in a field setting where individual and organizational performance could be reliably observed and measured. Findings suggest more compressed pay dispersions are positively related to multiple measures of individual and organizational performance.</p>
            <p>Our study asked why corporations introduce formal programs to manage ethics and why those programs display varying characteristics. We used control theory to delineate an ethics program's scope and its orientation toward compliance- and values-based control. Managerial choice theory suggests that environmental factors and management's ethical commitment will influence these dimensions. Environmental factors were the stronger influences on scope, but management commitment was the stronger determinant of control orientation. Research and policy implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>We examined the antecedents, consequences, and mediational role of team empowerment using 111 work teams in four organizations. The results indicated that the actions of external leaders, the production/service responsibilities given to teams, team-based human resources policies, and the social structure of teams all worked to enhance employee team empowerment experiences. More empowered teams were also more productive and proactive than less empowered teams and had higher levels of customer service, job satisfaction, and organizational and team commitment.</p>
            <p>We examine the methodological and philosophical implications of cross-cultural management research, comparing a field study conducted collaboratively in the United Kingdom and China with Teagarden and colleagues' survey-based international study. Our findings confirm those authors' calls for flexibility in cross-cultural research and for careful management of research team relationships but also highlight the significant effects that power differences and contrasting views about research can have on the conduct of cross-cultural research. Further, we identified reflexivity as a valuable component of cross-cultural management research, especially when there is a need to combine insider and outsider perspectives.</p>

            <p>Do firms committed to stewardship of the natural environment differ from less environmentally committed firms in their perceptions of the relative importance of different stakeholders in influencing their environmental practices? Using cluster analysis on six responses to questions describing a firm's practices, we classified 400 firms into four environmental profiles: reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive. Results indicate that firms with more proactive profiles do differ from less environmentally committed firms in their perceptions of the relative importance of different stakeholders.</p>

            <p>Skarlicki and Folger (1997) found that distributive, procedural, and interactional justice interacted to predict workplace retaliation. In this follow-up and extension of that study, we investigated whether a person-by-situation interaction explained variance in workplace retaliation beyond what could be attributed to fairness perceptions alone. Negative affectivity and agreeableness were found to moderate the relationship between fairness perceptions and retaliation.</p>

            <p>This article pictures a fascinating and sometimes confusing world in which different schools of thought, several methodological approaches, and distinct foci in terms of industrial background, modes of cooperation, and international patterns lay out the complexity against which one has to understand interorganizational networks and alliances. Given the multifaceted character of this topic, we encourage researchers to incorporate major elements of a multidimensional orientation in their future research.</p>
            <p>This study examined the effects of partner nationality, organizational dissimilarity, and economic motivation on the dissolution of joint ventures. Event-history analysis was used to test the hypotheses in a sample of 186 ventures. Cultural distance in general did not have an effect on dissolution, but U.S.-Japanese joint ventures lasted longer than U.S.-U.S. joint ventures. Prior relationships between partners appeared to negate some complexities arising from cultural differences. Opportunistic threat and rivalry appeared to be a stronger indication of the dissolution of joint ventures than organizational variables.</p>
            <p>In transaction cost economics, trust has been treated as redundant or even misleading. This study tested the effects of governance and trust on the risk perceived by agents of firms in alliances. Two dimensions of relational risk were assessed: the probability that something will go wrong and the size of the loss incurred when it does. Hypotheses, tested with survey data on the customer relations of ten suppliers of electrical/electronic components, were well corroborated, with trust-related variables as well as others found to have significant effects.</p>

            <p>This study's predictions are that businesses developing high-complexity technologies face higher risks of failure than other businesses because of greater competency demands and higher organization costs. Further, alliances moderate such failure risks but provide fewer survival benefits for businesses commercializing less complex technologies. Hypotheses were tested with longitudinal data from the U.S. hospital software industry. High-complexity technology was associated with higher risk of failure, and alliances only partially moderated such risk.</p>

            <p>This article presents the results of a comparative study of two networks of small- to medium-sized manufacturing enterprises in the U.S. wood products industry. Qualitative and survey data were collected from a sample of active participants in each network as well as from a sample of firms that were not network members (market firms) in the same industry. Using both qualitative and network analysis methodologies, we developed a model and testable propositions concerning key aspects of network structure and outcomes.</p>

Results support a multidimensional view of perceived uncertainty and the existence of significant variation in the link between perceived environmental uncertainty and alliance use, which arises as a consequence of key managers' entrepreneurial and individualism/collectivism orientations.</p>

            <p>Successful international joint ventures ential both learning to operate across national boundaries and learning to cooperate. Hypotheses grounded in organizational learning theory were tested with event-history analysis and data on 1,493 expansions of 25 large Dutch firms between 1966 and 1994. Experience with domestic joint ventures and with international wholly owned subsidiaries contributed to the longevity of international joint ventures, but prior experience with international joint ventures did not.</p>

This study integrates the two perspectives and examines their separate and combined effects on alliance outcomes. The research involved analysis of 98 alliances through a two-stage survey design. Findings support a positive relationship between partner firms' benefits from alliance participation and partner reputation, shared decision making, and strategic similarities between partners.</p>

            <p>We explored the differences between the joint venture, total ownership, and partial equity positions used by Japanese companies investing in U.S. manufacturing via a secondary data analysis. Partial ownership was used significantly more often in high-technology industries. Joint ventures were significantly more likely to be used in politically sensitive industries and in new entities, and when the Japanese partner had experience with the product.</p>
            <p>This study brings a fresh approach--a learning perspective--to the literature examining whether firms expand internationally through start-ups or acquisitions. Hypotheses concern how this strategic choice is influenced by a firm's multinational diversity and product diversity. The results show that multinational diversity leads to foreign start-ups rather than acquisitions. Product diversity has a curvilinear effect on the tendency to use start-ups. The curvilinear effect becomes weaker at higher levels of multinational diversity.</p>

            <p>This study analyzed 119 strategic alliances formed during the period 1987-91. Using the event study methodology, we found that announcements of technological alliances enjoyed greater abnormal returns in the stock market than marketing alliance announcements. Consistent with our expectations, abnormal returns were negatively correlated with firm profitability and size, indicating that investors perceived more profitable, larger firms as capturing less of the gain generated in alliances. Indeed, the smaller partners in technological alliances appeared to benefit the most. Finally, investor uncertainty increased following alliance announcements for marketing alliances but not for technological alliances.</p>

            <p>This study tested hypotheses developed from the distinct literatures on negotiations and coalitions and hypotheses integrating the two. In a complex, three-person negotiation simulation, subjects had to decide jointly how to allocate two resource pools. They were given multiple pieces of information regarding their negotiation preferences, coalition alternatives, and entitlements. Coalition alternatives and entitlement cues affected only the resource pool to which they were directly linked, but compatible interests, through the coalitions they generated, affected both resource pools, including the one to which these interests were not directly linked. We discuss the importance of integrating negotiation and coalition research in a way that incorporates the social dynamics of the negotiation interaction.</p>

            <p>This study investigated the relationship between interpersonal relationships among members of different departments and individuals' perceptions of intergroup conflict within an organization. Although friendships across groups were not significantly related to perceptions of intergroup conflict, negative relationships were associated with higher perceived intergroup conflict. Perceptions of intergroup conflict were also significantly related to indirect relationships through friends, and an amplification effect was uncovered. Finally, low intragroup cohesiveness was significantly related to higher perceptions of intergroup conflict.</p>
            <p> Despite the documented increase in skill-based pay programs in organizations, little evidence exists on whether these plans achieve the results intended. Using time series data, this study examined productivity and labor cost outcomes over 37 months. Likewise, quality outcomes were examined using time series data from treatment and comparison facilities. The results indicated greater productivity (58%), lower labor cost per part (16%), and favorable quality outcomes (82 percent scrap reduction vis-√†-vis the comparison facility) with skill-based pay. These results are consistent with the behavioral and operations theories underlying skill-based pay. </p>
            <p>A scenario study and a field survey were used to investigate why managers often lay off employees in a curt, abrupt fashion. The extent to which mismanagement (versus external conditions) caused the need for layoffs was found to affect managers' reported feelings of discomfort and the time designated for dismissal meetings with employees. Further results showed that mismanagement was also related to managers' anticipation of negative consequences from actions by layoff victims, such as hostile confrontations and sabotage.</p>

            <p>This study examined the relationships between situational constraints, leader-member exchange, goal commitment, and performance in a retail organization. Both situational constraints and leader-member exchange correlated significantly with commitment to assigned goals, and an interaction between leader-member exchange and goal commitment accounted for a significant amount of variance in sales performance.</p>
            <p>We examined the impact of surface-level (demographic) and deep-level (attitudinal) diversity on group social integration. As hypothesized, the length of time group members worked together weakened the effects of surface-level diversity and strengthened the effects of deep-level diversity as group members had the opportunity to engage in meaningful interactions.</p>
            <p>Results of this field study of 597 employees demonstrate the importance of extra-role behavior in explaining employee performance over a six-month period. Supervisors, peers, and employees differentiated in-role from extra-role behavior. They also differentiated two related forms of promotive extra-role behavior: helping and voice. We cross-validate our results and conclude by discussing future research implications.</p>
            <p>A social network perspective was used to determine whom brokerage firm employees selected as social referents. In particular, this study focused on cohesive actors (friends) and structurally equivalent actors (individuals occupying the same position in a network) as sources of social information. Results on the social networks of brokers, sales assistants, and operations employees (support staff) indicate distinct differences in interaction patterns, information seeking, and social comparison processes across the three job categories. Overall, the results suggest that employees rely on structurally equivalent referents for job-related information and on cohesive referents for general organizational information and as social comparison referents.</p>

            <p>This study extends previous research on the multilevel theory of team decision making and shows that team-level decision-making accuracy is affected by factors originating at lower levels of analysis. The results from 380 individuals arrayed into 95 fourperson teams working on a simulated naval command and control task indicated that the constructs specified by this theory accounted for over half of the variance in team performance and that teams given feedback on those constructs performed better than control teams. We elaborate on the relationships among the core constructs and further elucidate the process by which they affect overall team decision-making accuracy.</p>
            <p>In this study, we extended agency-based research by examining the role of risk in the structure of managerial compensation and its relationship to organization performance. Our results suggest that organizations facing higher risk do not place greater emphasis on short-term incentives than other organizations--rather, they place less emphasis on them. Also, higher-risk firms that relied on incentive pay exhibited poorer performance than higher-risk firms that did not emphasize incentive pay.</p>
            <p>Subordinate and supervisor leader-member exchange (LMX) were examined as correlates of delegation and as moderators of relationships between delegation and subordinate performance and satisfaction. Raw score analyses of data on 106 dyads showed both to be significantly related to delegation and to have similar main and moderating effects for subordinate performance and satisfaction. Finally, within- and between-groups analyses largely supported the level-of-analysis predictions of the LMX approach. Implications for future LMX research are discussed.</p>

            <p>Recent labor economics studies suggest that low enterprise productivity in former socialist economies can be corrected by adopting reward systems emphasizing compensation for performance. We used the equity sensitivity construct to test for differences in the attitudes toward equity of business students from the United States and five countries of Central and Eastern Europe. "Entitlement attitudes" were more pervasive in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe than in the United States, suggesting U.S. compensation practices may not be directly applicable in that region.</p>
            <p>An investigation of ethical decision making in a negotiation context revealed that focal actors' incentives influenced not only their misrepresentation, but also their expectations of their opponents' misrepresentation, suggesting that individuals hold "motivated expectations" about their opponents. The notion that individuals engage in defensive ethics received only modest support. The incentives of opponents influenced expectations about their misrepresentation but did not impact the focal actors' misrepresentation; however, correlational data revealed a significant relationship between the opponents' temptation and the focal actors' misrepresentation that was mediated by expectations of the opponents' misrepresentation. Furthermore, temptation mediated the proposed relationships, suggesting that it may serve as an individual factor filtering the situational influence of incentives.</p>
            <p>A comparative analysis of professionals' use of individual self-managing activities in functional and cross-functional units found that individual self-management was beneficial for effectiveness in functional units but not in cross-functional units. The study also explored the effects of interactions of individual self-management and unit type (functional or cross-functional) on team members' overall levels of job satisfaction and perceptions of bureaucratic obstacles. Results suggest a need for a contingency model of self-management and a need to pursue the multidimensionality of the self-management construct.</p>
            <p>Our purpose was to test an explanation of how procedural justice may influence organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). The model tested suggests that procedural justice affects OCB by influencing perceived organizational support, which in turn prompts employees to reciprocate with organizational citizenship behaviors. Results suggest that procedural justice is an antecedent to perceived organizational support, which in turn fully mediates its relationship to three of four OCB dimensions.</p>
            <p>We integrate the efficiency and competitive effects of product-market scope choice into a comprehensive model of economic performance and empirically test the model in the context of the U.S. airline industry. Efficiency is influenced by a firm's scope economies, but the intensity of rivalry is determined by multimarket contact with rivals and their scope economies. The confluence of strong scope economies with multimarket contact results in superior economic performance. However, strong scope economies may not result in superior performance if rivals can obtain similar economies in nonoverlapping markets.</p>

            <p>This study investigated the conditions under which employees are more or less likely to become targets of coworkers' aggressive actions. Results from a field survey showed people high in negative affectivity more often perceived themselves as victims, as did people who were low in the self-determination component of empowerment. In addition, hierarchical status appeared to buffer the influence of negative affectivity: Negative affectivity was not related to indirect victimization for higher-status people but was positively related to indirect victimization for lower-status people.</p>
            <p>It is argued that employees' attraction to and trust in their peers, and their organization-based self-esteem mediate the effect of demographic dissimilarity on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Data from a field study support a model in which the relationship between demographic dissimilarity and OCB is contingent on demographic characteristics and work group composition and mediated to an extent by the proposed mediators. The influence of race dissimilarity varied in strength for white and minority employees, but the influence of age dissimilarity varied in direction for older and younger employees.</p>
            <p>The present study examined the impact of employees' use of influence tactics on their evaluations of the fairness of the performance evaluation process. Results indicated that the use of supervisor-focused influence tactics was associated with positive procedural justice evaluations, but the use of job-focused influence tactics was associated with negative evaluations. Also, employees' perceptions of decision control and opportunity for formal voice were found to moderate the relationship between influence tactics and procedural justice.</p>
            <p>We tested three published models of union commitment's antecedents and consequences as well as an integrative model, using correlation coefficients derived from 15 meta-analyses of five union commitment correlates: prounion attitudes, union instrumentality, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and union participation. The integrative model offered significantly better fit to the data than the other models, suggesting that the effects of job satisfaction and union instrumentality on union commitment are partially mediated by organizational commitment and union attitudes, respectively. Also, prounion attitudes had an effect on union commitment equal to, if not stronger than, that of union instrumentality.</p>
            <p>We use the interpersonal dispute resolution literature to develop hypotheses regarding how organizations respond to adjudicated conflicts. Our hypotheses were tested with data from disputes litigated at the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, which has been called "the chief arbiter of right and wrong in corporate America" (New York Times, 1995). Our results underscore the important role that legal agents play in organization-level dispute resolution. We also highlight the different power bases of disputants as factors influencing favorable outcomes at the Chancery.</p>
            <p>Examining the association between managerial assessments of risk and expected return using nonexperimental data from specific commercial lending decisions, we found that risk-return associations depended on the measures used. However, with a return measure that accounted for the expected costs of riskier decisions, risk and return were negatively related. We also found evidence of conservatism in managers' adjusting to new information regarding the riskiness of decisions. The study points toward the need for more careful understanding of managerial definitions of risk and return, careful handling of leads and lags, and understanding risky decisions in their organizational and market contexts.</p>
            <p>Examining a sample of journal articles, we develop a grounded theory of contribution that shows how organization studies theorists textually construct opportunities for making contributions to the field. The analyses reveal two major processes and the associated rhetorical practices that texts invoke in establishing opportunities for contribution. The study's findings point to the richness of contribution by illuminating how uniqueness claims are textually produced and legitimated in the context of science. The construction of contribution in organization studies is more complicated than has been assumed.</p>
            <p>Although management researchers would like to understand management decisions related to risk, almost all previous research on risk has used either experiments or aggregate corporate data rather than data from actual business decisions. In this initial research on risk in actual business decisions, we examined the risk assessments bankers assigned to commercial borrowers. We tested hypotheses derived from research in strategy, finance, and behavioral decision theory in order to assess the influence of both organizational and cognitive factors on the likelihood of risk assessment errors. Although we found that both organizational and cognitive factors influenced risky decision making, when both were present, organizational factors appeared to overwhelm cognitive biases.</p>

            <p>This article describes four approaches to the employee-organization relationship, as defined from the employer's perspective. An empirical study of employees from ten companies found support for the basic hypothesis that employee responses differ under the four types of relationship. In general, employees performed better on core tasks, demonstrated more citizenship behavior, and expressed a higher level of affective commitment to an employer when they worked in an overinvestment (by the employer) or mutual investment relationship than when they worked in a quasi-spot-contract or underinvestment relationship. These results were obtained even after we controlled for several other variables that could affect employee performance and attitudes.</p>

            <p>Results of a primary meta-analysis indicated a significant main effect of the organizational behavior modification (O.B. Mod.) approach on task performance (d. =.51; a 17 percent increase) and a significant treatment-by-study interaction. To account for within-group heterogeneity of effect sizes, we conducted a two-level theory-driven moderator analysis by partitioning the sample of studies first into manufacturing and service groups and then into seven classes of reinforcement interventions. Results indicated a stronger average effect of O.B. Mod. in manufacturing organizations, moderation by the type of contingent interventions, and "pairwise" differences among average effect sizes in both organizational types. The practical implications of these findings for solving the challenge of improving performance without adding cost are discussed.</p>

            <p>In this research, I proposed and tested a model of how firms learn from their strategic alliances. Based on a survey of 151 firms, the results suggest that experience alone is insufficient for the achievement of the greatest benefits from collaboration. Experience must be internalized first, and collaborative know-how must be developed for this experience to contribute to future collaborative benefits.</p>
            <p>Using data from companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 between 1980 and 1994, we examined 5,479 occurrences of changes in employment in terms of two dependent variables: profitability (return on assets) and return on common stock. Firms that engaged in pure employment downsizing did not show significantly higher returns than the average companies in their own industries. However, companies that combined employment downsizing with asset restructuring generated higher returns on assets and stock returns than firms in their own industries.</p>
            <p>Research on both ethics and organizational justice distinguishes between process and outcome concerns. However, little research integrates these two areas. This study examined the influence of individuals' ethical frameworks on perceptions of organizational justice. We found that ethical formalists were more sensitive to procedural justice issues and ethical utilitarians were more sensitive to distributive justice issues. The implications of these results for both organizational justice and ethics are discussed.</p>
            <p>In the model tested, we posit that employees' outcome and supervisor satisfaction result from referent outcomes, justifications, and the likelihood of amelioration. These satisfaction facets are then related to turnover through withdrawal cognitions. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of this model and alternatives. Although the original model had a good fit, a competing model provided a better one, with most hypothesized relationships supported. The implications of accepting the alternative model over the original are discussed.</p>
            <p>Ever since Hambrick and Mason suggested that external individual characteristics can be used as substitutes for individuals' cognitive bases, management researchers have been using these characteristics as proxies for cognition. However, the actual evidence for a relationship between cognitive bases and individual characteristics is equivocal at best. My study of 91 managers showed a relationship between some of the most cited characteristics and beliefs, but I argue that such a finding does not support substituting characteristics for cognition.</p>

            <p>Miller, Cardinal, and Glick (1997) challenged the conclusions in Golden (1992b), which examined the use of retrospective data in strategic management research. Further, the authors suggest that my findings have led many other researchers to avoid the use of retrospective data. The present note suggests recent researchers have not entirely avoided retrospective data but have perhaps added precautions when using such data. I also suggest that Miller and colleagues did not fully represent important aspects of my research and inappropriately compare my study with others.</p>
            <p>In this study, we propose that culture provides scripts and schemes for negotiation. The implications for negotiation of two cultural values, individualism/collectivism and hierarchy/egalitarianism, are discussed. The primary hypothesis, that joint gains will be lower in intercultural negotiations between U.S. and Japanese negotiators than in intracultural negotiations between either U.S. or Japanese negotiators, was confirmed with data from 30 intercultural, 47 U.S.-U.S. intracultural, and 18 Japanese-Japanese intracultural simulated negotiations. Tests of secondary hypotheses indicated that there was less understanding of the priorities of the other party and the utility of a compatible issue in inter- than in intracultural negotiations. When information about priorities was available, intercultural negotiators were less able than intracultural negotiators to use it to generate joint gains.</p>

            <p>Although there are many individual-level models of turnover, little research has examined the effects of human resource management practices on quit rates and discharge rates at the organizational level. This study used organization-level data from 227 organizations in the trucking industry to explore this issue. Results show that human resource management practices predict quit rates and discharge rates but that the determinants of each are quite different. Implications are derived and directions for future research suggested.</p>
            <p>Previous research has emphasized either situational or dispositional/motivational variables as determinants of job satisfaction. The current study suggests that cognitive variables, and intelligence in particular, may also be important determinants. The relationship between intelligence and job satisfaction was analyzed on the basis of a model in which intelligence has a direct negative effect on job satisfaction, an indirect positive effect, mediated by job complexity, and an interactive effect with job complexity. The roles of background variables, in particular education, and the implications of the findings for theories of job satisfaction were also examined.</p>

            <p>This study introduces a theory-based measure of employee performance, the Role-Based Performance Scale (RBPS), that is supported with results from a validation study using ten data sets from six companies. In contrast to traditional, job-related measures of employee performance, this proposed alternative measure of performance is based on role theory and identity theory. Because our results support the validity of the scale, we think that the instrument can be used for future research that requires a generalizable measure of performance. The scale demonstrates diagnostic properties that make it useful for practitioners as well as researchers.</p>
            <p>In a sample of 105 firms in Spain, a relationship was found between strategic proactivity and approaches to the natural environment. The firms with the most proactive business strategies ("prospectors") employed both traditional corrective and modern preventive natural environmental approaches. Firm size had a major impact on the amount of training relating to the natural environment in the sample firms and on their corrective approaches but made no difference to their preventive approaches.</p>
            <p>This research examined managers' reactions to the implementation of a procedurally just performance management system in two samples. Findings indicated that managers who perceived unfairness in their own most recent performance evaluations reacted more favorably to the implementation of a procedurally just system than those who did not perceive unfairness.</p>
            <p>
            <p>A multitheoretical approach was used to explore why organizations vary in the degree to which they have adopted policies designed to help employees manage their work and family lives. Our findings indicated that: (1) significant differences existed across industries in work-family responsiveness; (2) the percentage of women employed by a company did not explain unique variance in responsiveness; and (3) organizations were more likely to offer benefits when work and family issues were salient to senior human resource staff and thought likely to impact the organization's performance if unaddressed.</p>
            <p>Theory suggests and results show that firm performance is initially positive but eventually levels off and becomes negative as international diversification increases. Product diversification moderates the relationship between international diversification and performance. International diversification is negatively related to performance in nondiversified firms, positively related in highly product-diversified firms, and curvilinearly related in moderately product-diversified firms. International diversification is also positively related to R&amp;D intensity, but the interaction effects with product diversification are negative. The results of this study provide evidence of the importance of international diversification for competitive advantage but also suggest the complexities of implementing it to achieve these advantages in product-diversified firms.</p>
            <p>The reported research examines the relative contributions of prospect and agency theory explanations for specific operational risks and subsequent firm performance in regulated and unregulated environments. Specifically, this study simultaneously models competing theoretical explanations for risk using three distinct realized operational risks managed by savings and loan (S&amp;L) firms. It then examines the effects of these risks on performance. Implications of this study argue for a mesotheoretic approach to the modeling of risk and for its disaggregation into distinct risk choices.</p>
            <p>Drawing on industrial relations and organizational science concepts, in this article we apply elements of contingency theory to national unions' representative and administrative structures. We argue that these structures are distinct and develop in response to different organizational and environmental imperatives. These ideas were tested with a unique set of data on unions' characteristics and environments. The results provide broad support for our approach and suggest that greater colaboration among industrial relations and organizational science scholars would benefit both literatures.</p>
            <p>Qualitative data collected in a rehabilitation unit of a large hospital reveal how organization members used dress to represent and negotiate a web of issues inherent to the hybrid identities of the unit and the nursing profession. As different issues were considered, dress took on various and often contradictory meanings. Thus, a seemingly simple symbol such as organizational dress is shown here to reveal the complex notion of social identity, which is argued to comprise multiple layers of meaning. We discuss the implications of this thesis for theory and research on organizational identity, organizational symbolism, organizational dress, and ambivalence.</p>

            <p>It is widely argued that modern manufacturing settings require employees to adopt a customer-focused strategic orientation and a broad and proactive role orientation. Yet empirical investigation of this issue is lacking. We describe the development of measures of both types of work orientation and present two field studies that examine how these orientations change. Findings suggest that, although the implementation of new production practices can in itself lead to the development of a strategic orientation appropriate to modern manufacturing, change toward a more flexible role orientation additionally requires the introduction of autonomous forms of working.</p>
            <p>Van de Vliert and Van Yperen's (1996) proposal that ambient temperature explains the relationship between national cultural values and typical levels of role stress is reevaluated. The provisional conclusion is that the effect of ambient temperature on role stress is largely mediated by its contribution to the historical evolution of cultural values.</p>
            <p>This study explored whether applicants' preinterview job beliefs affected their interview behavior and postinterview reactions. I obtained 106 pre- and postinterview applicant surveys and audiotapes of 24 interviews. Results indicated that applicants' preinterview expectancies correlated positively with their impression management tactics, confirmatory questions, and perceptions of recruiters. Perceptions of recruiters partially mediated pre- to postinterview job-belief relationships. Job-knowledge confidence and the expected total number of job offers moderated effects of preinterview beliefs on confirmatory questions. Research and practical implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>This study examined the role that the gender of job informants plays in the job-finding process for men and women. Data on job seekers at a large bank were used to test hypotheses derived from work on social distance and gender segregation. Our results suggest that jobs found via cross-gender referrals are hierarchically lower than the jobs of the informants and that women refer job seekers to gender-typical jobs more than men do.</p>
            <p>This study examined the relation of cognitive factors (implicit theories, self-schemas, and perceived similarity) to liking and leader-member exchange (LMX) in a field setting. Perceived similarity significantly predicted LMX quality, with liking mediating this relationship. Supervisor-subordinate match on implicit performance theories, the normativeness of both subordinates' and supervisors' self-schemas, and subordinates' negative affectivity also predicted liking and LMX ratings. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

            <p>A study of 230 private colleges over 16 turbulent years supports two arguments: (1) Strong ties to other organizations mitigate uncertainty and promote adaptation by increasing communication and information sharing. (2) Networks can promote social learning of adaptive responses, rather than other, less productive, forms of interorganizational imitation. Colleges that were members of smaller, older, and more homogeneous intercollegiate consortia were more likely to undertake fundamental curriculum changes. Colleges tended to imitate similar consortium partners that were performing well rather than larger and more prestigious partners. Implications for organizational adaptation and the growing network perspective within organization theory are considered.</p>

            <p>If successful safety interventions are to be developed and implemented, the underlying causes of accidents must be accurately identified. Using two different samples and research designs, we investigated the influence of two contextual factors, safety climate and communication, on accident interpretation. The results for both samples indicated that contextual factors significantly influenced accident attributions. Implications for the implementation of change interventions and for organizations trying to learn from negative events are discussed.</p>

            <p>This cross-level field study, involving 187 employees from 35 groups in 20 organizations, examined how individuals' antisocial behaviors at work are shaped by the antisocial behavior of their coworkers. We found a positive relationship between the level of antisocial behavior exhibited by an individual and that exhibited by his or her coworkers. We also found that a number of factors moderated this relationship. Finally, we found that dissatisfaction with coworkers was higher when individuals engaged in less antisocial behavior than their coworkers.</p>
            <p>Through a quantitative meta-analysis of 40 studies of realistic job previews (RJPs), 26 of which were published, the effects of RJPs on attrition from the job recruitment process, the level and accuracy of initial job expectations, affective reactions, job performance, and turnover were assessed. In general, RJPs were related to higher performance and to lower attrition from the recruitment process, initial expectations, voluntary turnover, and all turnover. Moderating effects of the timing and medium of an RJP and of whether a study was conducted in the laboratory or the field indicated that the effectiveness of RJPs can be enhanced through properly matching RJP methods with the organizational outcomes of interest.</p>
            <p>This study, conducted in Singapore, where there are ongoing labor shortages, supports social exchange theory predictions that contingent workers engage in less organizational citizenship, expect less of their employers in their psychological contracts, and have lower affective commitment than regular employees. Contrary to expectations, the relationship between two attitudes--commitment and psychological contracts-- and organizational citizenship was stronger for contingent workers than for regular employees, indicating that when contingent workers have positive attitudes about their relationship with an organization, they engage in organizational citizenship behavior. We discuss the implications of these unexpected results for theory and practice.</p>

            <p>We examined the relationships among status of academic origin, status of academic affiliation, and research productivity for a sample of doctoral graduates in management. Contrary to expectations, the status of a graduate's academic origin did not appear to be strongly associated with his or her research productivity. The status of his or her academic affiliation, however, had a relatively strong association with research productivity in terms of both number of publications in top journals and citation counts of these publications.</p>
            <p>This research addressed empirical and conceptual issues raised by McWilliams and Siegel (1997) in light of the contradictory findings of several recent event studies dealing with announcements of withdrawal from South Africa. We concluded that the timing of withdrawal announcements is critical to understanding their impact and offer several explanations for the conflicting findings.</p>

            <p>The management of competing stakeholder interests has emerged as a significant topic in the management literature. Related issues are the relationship between stakeholder management and the perception that a firm is socially responsible, and the performance implications of both stakeholder management and social responsibility. Theory and models surrounding these issues are abundant, but empirical research is in an early stage. This research forum reports six excellent efforts to tackle fundamental ideas about stakeholders, social responsibility, and performance.</p>
            <p>Little empirical work has been done on the effect of stakeholder management on corporate performance. In this study, we contributed to stakeholder theory development by (1) deriving two distinct stakeholder management models from extant research, (2) testing the descriptive accuracy of these models, and (3) including important variables from the strategy literature in the tested models. The results provide support for a strategic stakeholder management model but no support for an intrinsic stakeholder commitment model. Implications of these findings for management practice and future research are discussed.</p>

            <p>Using unique data provided by the CEOs of 80 large U.S. firms, we examined relationships among the stakeholder attributes of power, legitimacy, urgency, and salience; CEO values; and corporate performance. We found strong support for the attribute-salience relationship and some significant relationships among CEO values, salience, and corporate social performance but found no support for a salience-financial performance link. Our findings suggest a need for continued emphasis on the development of normative stakeholder theory.</p>
            <p>This study examined a major contention of stakeholder theory: namely, that a firm can simultaneously enhance the interests of its shareholders and other relevant stakeholders. Financial data relating to the U.K. water supply industry and the customer service performance indicators introduced after privatization in 1989 to protect customer interests provided the basis of our empirical analysis. The results show that, although improving relative customer service performance is costly for firms in terms of current profits, shareholder returns respond in a significantly positive manner to such improvements. We interpret this finding as being consistent with stakeholder theory.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Corporations can respond to expectations for socially responsible processes and outcomes in organizationally integrated ways or in easily decoupled fashion. This study focused on a particular type of socially responsible organizational process: formal corporate ethics programs. Theory suggests that external pressures for social performance encourage easily decoupled processes but that top management commitments can encourage both easily decoupled and integrated processes. Analysis of survey and archival data generally supported this position. Implications for social performance research, practice, and public policy are discussed.</p>
            <p>This study examined the relationships between institutional influences and stakeholder representation on boards of directors. Data from 224 companies over the period 1984-94 were employed. Results indicate that variations in legal environments, industry regulation, and firm size are associated with stakeholder representation on boards but do not influence stakeholder representation on key board committees. Legal environments and firm size are associated with the adoption of stakeholder-oriented board committees.</p>
            <p>The effects of institutional investor types and governance devices on two dimensions of corporate social performance (CSP) were examined. Pension fund equity was positively related to both a people (women and minorities, community, and employee relations) and a product quality (product and environment) dimension of CSP, but mutual and investment bank funds exhibited no direct relationship with CSP. Outside director representation was positively related to both CSP dimensions. Top management equity was positively related to the product quality dimension but unrelated to the people dimension of CSP.</p>
            <p>Management of the natural environment is becoming an increasingly important issue to manufacturing firms, yet their managers are also challenged to implement changes that improve competitiveness. To meet this challenge, a new construct grounded in the resource-based view of the firm and manufacturing strategy has been developed: the environmental technology portfolio. The composition of a plant's portfolio--the pattern of its investment in environmental technologies in manufacturing over time--was found to significantly affect both manufacturing and environmental performance for a sample of manufacturing plants.</p>
            <p>There is much discussion about firms putting human resource management (HRM) to strategic use, in part by hiring senior HRM executives. This study explored whether that recommendation can help entrepreneurial, growth-oriented companies. By applying organizational inertia concepts, we investigated whether having a senior HRM executive reporting to a firm's CEO affected firm performance in a sample of firms making their initial public offerings (IPOs). Results indicate that smaller, fast-growing IPOs experience the most gain from having senior human resource executives.</p>

            <p>This study examined the work environment for creativity at a large high-technology firm before, during, and after a major downsizing. Creativity and most creativity-supporting aspects of the perceived work environment declined significantly during the downsizing but increased modestly later; the opposite pattern was observed for creativity-undermining aspects. Stimulants and obstacles to creativity in the work environment mediated the effects of downsizing. These results suggest ways in which theories of organizational creativity can be expanded and ways in which the negative effects of downsizing might be avoided or alleviated.</p>
            <p>We examined the relationship between taking a leave of absence and rewards among 11,815 managers in a financial services organization. Results indicated that leaves of absence, regardless of the reason for them (family responsibilities or illness) or the gender of the manager, were associated with significantly fewer subsequent promotions and smaller salary increases. Leaves of absence had a significant, negative relationship to performance ratings only if the leaves had been taken during the year of the performance evaluation.</p>
            <p>We investigated the effects of a company's success with using an existing information technology (IT) on its managers' strategic issue interpretations of new information technologies in their industry. We found that success with an existing IT resulted in a positive bias in managers' interpretations of new ITs. This bias was stronger among managers who had greater amounts of experience with the existing technology and among managers whose companies did not engage in proactive information seeking about new information technologies.</p>
            <p>This study examined how top management team diversity variables and debate interacted to influence two measures of company financial performance. Further, it assessed the degree to which decision comprehensiveness mediated those interaction effects. Multi-informant data from the top management teams of 57 manufacturing companies revealed that more job-related types of diversity interacted with debate to influence financial performance, but a less job-related type (age diversity) did not. Decision comprehensiveness partially mediated those effects.</p>
            <p>Although a host of theory-driven rationales suggest a relationship between board of directors size and firm performance, the literature provides no consensus about the direction of that relationship. A meta-analysis of 131 samples (N = 20,620) provided systematic evidence of nonzero, positive, true population estimates of board size-performance relationships.</p>
            <p>In this study, routine task responsibilities and professional organization memberships had positive effects on the professional commitment of medical technologists in the first four years of their careers, but advanced professional research activities had a negative effect. I obtained these results after controlling for a set of initial attitude, personal background, organizational context, and professional socialization variables.</p>
            <p>This study measured changes in the constituency of an organizational field centered around the issue of corporate environmentalism in the period 1960-93, correlating those changes with the institutions adopted by the U.S. chemical industry to interpret the issue. The article develops the ideas that fields form around issues, not markets or technologies; within fields, competing institutions may simultaneously exist; as institutions evolve, connections between their regulative, normative, and cognitive aspects arise; and field-level analyses can reveal the cultural and institutional origins of organizational impacts on the natural environment.</p>

            <p>Market share erosion and dethronement of market leaders are examined through the lens of "Austrian" economics. Our results suggest that leaders are more likely to experience market share erosion and/or dethronement when--relative to industry challengers--they are less competitively aggressive, carry out simpler repertoires of actions, and carry out competitive actions more slowly. These findings, based on seven years of data collected in 41 industries, contribute to research on hypercompetition, organizational decline, and competitive dynamics.</p>

            <p>Contradictory forces of dissent and consensus building attend the strategic decision process. Taking an information-processing perspective, we argue that two factors that affect perceptions of trustworthiness within strategic decision-making teams--loyalty and competence--play different roles in enabling dissent to enhance decision quality and build decision commitment. Results from a sample of 86 strategic decision-making teams in U.S. hospitals indicate that perceptions of loyalty within teams strengthen the relationship between dissent and decision quality. Perceptions of within-team competence strengthen the relationship between dissent and decision commitment.</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigated a neglected form of extrarole behavior called taking charge and sought to understand factors that motivate employees to engage in this activity. Taking charge is discretionary behavior intended to effect organizationally functional change. We obtained both self-report and coworker data for 275 whitecollar employees from different organizations. Taking charge, as reported by coworkers, related to felt responsibility, self-efficacy, and perceptions of top management openness. These results expand current understanding of extrarole behavior and suggest ways in which organizations can motivate employees to go beyond the boundaries of their jobs to bring about positive change.</p>
            <p>Economic control frameworks such as agency theory start with the assumption that employee and employer interests naturally diverge, whereas alternative control frameworks imply that employee and employer interests are often aligned. Integrating these literatures, we hypothesized that value alignment moderates the impact of pay for performance on extrarole behaviors. Our study of employees in the utility industry supported this hypothesis. Pay for performance had a negative impact on extrarole behaviors for employees low in value alignment but not for employees high in value alignment.</p>
            <p>We examined how inquiring and monitoring for feedback from peers and supervisors changed over time for transferees. Hypotheses were grounded in uncertainty reduction and impression management theory. Results from a longitudinal study in which data were collected three times over a year indicated that monitoring for feedback from peers and supervisors remained constant over time, as did inquiry from supervisors, but that inquiry from peers declined. In addition, role clarity negatively influenced subsequent peer inquiry. Results suggest the need to examine how both uncertainty reduction and impression management concerns influence feedback seeking.</p>
            <p>A large but dated literature indicates that academia does not reward individuals for contributions to science, instead applying sponsored mobility norms, whereby individuals are rewarded when they are sponsored by established academics. The reported study examined whether contemporary universities' hiring decisions are better described by tournament or sponsored mobility. Departing from the findings of past research, our longitudinal data indicated that management departments currently employ tournament-based criteria when distributing jobs.</p>
            <p>This work reports further theoretical development of Lee and Mitchell's (1994) unfolding model of voluntary turnover, which describes different psychological paths that people take when quitting organizations. Ambiguities in the model were identified, and hypotheses aimed at resolving these ambiguities were tested on a sample of 229 former employees from the "Big 6" public accounting firms. The results provide a theoretical and quantitative extension of an earlier qualitative assessment of the unfolding model. Implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>We conducted an inductive study of the everyday decisions about dress at work of female administrative employees in a university business school. Our findings reveal that dress is an attribute embedded in a variety of cognitive schemata that govern individuals' comprehension of and behavior at work. In acquiring and executing these schemata, employees make efforts that enhance their emotional preparedness for jobs and improve interpersonal relations. The study offers implications for theory and research on organizational symbolism, role taking, and the current practical trend toward relaxed dress.</p>

            <p>To what extent do broadly based sociocultural norms affect the distribution of organizational characteristics within a population over time? Under what circumstances are institutional norms more important than alternative processes, such as market forces, in shaping this distribution? This sociohistorical analysis of the impact of nationalism on the language of publication of Finnish newspapers in the 19th century examines the interplay of institutional, ecological, and economic forces. The findings confirm that the power with which institutional norms influence organizations can vary over time, across levels of analysis, and as a function of ecological and economic forces and other, more proximal, sources of institutional expectations.</p>

            <p>Employees develop exchange relationships both with organizations and immediate superiors, as evidenced by research on perceived organizational support (POS) and leader-member exchange (LMX), respectively. Despite conceptual similarities between these two constructs, theoretical development and research has proceeded independently. In an attempt to integrate these literatures, we developed and tested a model of the antecedents and consequences of POS and LMX, based on social exchange theory. Results indicated that POS and LMX have unique antecedents and are differentially related to outcome variables, providing support for the importance of both types of exchanges.</p>
            <p>Applicant race did not directly affect promotion decisions for top management positions in a cabinet-level U.S. government department with standardized promotion practices that include a panel review process. However, race indirectly affected promotion decisions through key job-relevant variables, to the disadvantage of applicants of color.</p>

            <p>Longer-term performance effects of corporate illegality were investigated. Results show that firms experience lower accounting returns over five years and slower sales growth in the third through fifth year after a conviction. Stakeholders appear to paint all corporate wrongdoers with the same brush, ignoring the seriousness of illegalities, but responding strongly to multiple convictions for wrongdoing. Reduced financial performance does not deter subsequent illegality.</p>
            <p>This study examined how chief executive and top management team characteristics interact with organizational performance to influence strategic change. Results indicate that poor performance, long chief executive and top management team tenures, and high diversity in top management team tenure are associated with greater levels of strategic change. In addition, poor performance moderated the relationship between managerial characteristics and strategic change, increasing the likelihood of the latter.</p>

            <p>We evaluated the impact of human resource (HR) managers' capabilities on HR management effectiveness and the latter's impact on corporate financial performance. For 293 U.S. firms, effectiveness was associated with capabilities and attributes of HR staff. We also found relationships between HR management effectiveness and productivity, cash flow, and market value. Findings were consistent across market and accounting measures of performance and with corrections for biases.</p>

            <p>Retrospective reports of important organizational phenomena are commonly used in strategic management and organization theory research. A recent study, however, suggested that these reports tend to be inaccurate and seriously questioned their use. Our reexamination of this study suggests the situation is not so dire. Our work suggests that retrospective reporting is a viable research methodology if the measure used to generate the reports is adequately reliable and valid. Retrospective reports should neither be rejected nor used indiscriminately.</p>

            <p>This study provides a multiple-levels-of-analysis investigation of transformational and contingent reward leadership and outcomes involving female leaders. We tested multisource data from male and female sales-persons and their female sales managers for individual-, dyad-, and group-level effects via within and between analysis (WABA). As hypothesized, the associations of interest were based on differences between dyads. Each female leader formed a unique relationship with each subordinate that was independent of their group membership.</p>
            <p>The link between organizational configurations and performance has become a central and somewhat controversial focus of research in the strategic management literature. We statistically aggregated results from 40 original tests of the configurations-performance relationship. In contrast to previous qualitative reviews, this meta-analysis demonstrated that an organization's performance is partially explained by its configuration. Tests of four potential moderators showed that organizations' configurations contributed more to performance explanation to the extent that studies used (1) broad definitions of configurations, (2) single-industry samples, and (3) longitudinal designs. Results highlight the need for programmatic research.</p>
            <p>The 1997 Special Research Forum on Teaching Effectiveness in the Organizational Sciences represents an effort both to recognize the role of the scholarship of teaching and to enhance teaching effectiveness via empirical research. We sought to advance research about good teaching and effective learning in the organizational sciences. We first discuss the changing climate for effective teaching and learning in business schools. Then we provide a brief overview of the current state of knowledge and our view of future needs for research about teaching effectiveness in the organizational sciences. Next, we describe the history and purpose of this forum. Finally, we give an overview of the articles it includes.</p>
            <p>Technology-mediated distance learning is becoming increasingly important to business curricula. However, little theoretical development or empirical research has examined teaching effectiveness in distance learning. Thus, this article draws from research in management communications, education, and information systems to develop an initial conceptualization of influences on technology-mediated distance learning outcomes. It then reports on an exploratory study utilizing both qualitative and quantitative techniques to examine 247 students' reactions to such distance learning.</p>
            <p>This article describes the design and delivery of a graduate-level course in management at two universities via advanced information technology, which was used to enable collaborative learning, teaching with transcontinental student teams and multiple instructors, and integration of external expertise. This partnership enriched student learning and expedited faculty and institutional development. We predict that such transformations will increase as schools of management and institutions of higher learning in general seek to add educational value at low cost.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Process design principles from organization science offer insights for constructing learning systems that produce consistent, high-quality management education. We incorporated key process design concepts into a structure for graduate and undergraduate management and organizational behavior courses and then tested predictions using path analysis and comparative measures of dispersion. Results indicate that variety designed into a learning system can overcome extensive individual differences in student inputs and yield uniformly high levels of perceived personal effectiveness, organizational effectiveness, ability to apply course materials, and satisfaction with both course results and the educational process.</p>
            <p>The present study was an empirical analysis designed to measure the social networks of master of business administration (M.B.A.) students and the networks' relationships to attitudinal and performance outcomes. Results from 250 students indicated that centrality in friendship, communication, and adversarial networks affected both student attitudes and grades. Moreover, an analysis of 62 assigned teams showed that relationships within and between teams also had significant effects on student perceptions of team effectiveness and objective team performance. Implications for student networks and suggestions for future research are discussed.</p>

            <p>Five employee management rhetorics have swept U.S. managerial discourse over the last century: welfare work, scientific management, human relations and personnel management, systems rationalism, and organization culture and quality. I tested two competing theses: the performance-gap thesis, according to which the popularity of rhetorics that promise to narrow organizational performance gaps fluctuates with the magnitude of these gaps across organizations, and the pendulum thesis, according to which the popularity of these rhetorics has been related to upswings and downswings in long waves of macroeconomic activity. I measured rhetorics' popularity between 1875 and 1992 using yearly counts of articles. Results suggest that the two theses are in fact complementary.</p>

            <p>Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we posited that environmental performance and economic performance are positively linked and that industry growth moderates the relationship, with the returns to environmental performance higher in high-growth industries. We tested these hypotheses with an analysis of 243 firms over two years, using independently developed environmental ratings. Results indicate that "it pays to be green" and that this relationship strengthens with industry growth. We conclude by highlighting the study's academic and managerial implications, making special reference to the social issues in management literature.</p>

            <p>Much of the strategic management literature separates industry, corporate, and business levels of analysis, and empirical studies tend to examine these levels independently, not addressing how industry context influences diversification and how diversification strategy might influence business strategies. This article examines the interactions of industry characteristics, diversification, and business strategy in an integrated framework and offers a comprehensive model illustrating how these factors combine to influence performance. We tested the model using data from a sample of Fortune 500 firms.</p>
            <p>Using a laboratory design, we examined the simple and interactive effects of monitoring and incentive alignment on managerial decisions. Length of term in office was a third independent variable. Results show that incentive alignment was a more powerful mechanism than monitoring for ensuring that agents acted in the interests of owners. An interaction of monitoring, incentive alignment, and term in office revealed that these effects are relatively complicated and deserve further study. Also, incentive alignment had a beneficial effect for the principal for long-term CEOs, even though the tendency to escalate (an effect negative for principals) was greatest for those agents.</p>
            <p>In two studies, 264 male and female managers reviewed information about the job performance of a person portrayed as either a man or a woman and, if a woman, as either an affirmative action hire or not. As expected, subjects rated female affirmative action hires as less competent and recommended smaller salary increases for them than for men and women not associated with affirmative action. This pattern held even when disconfirming performance information was provided if that information was ambiguous either with regard to degree of success (Study 1) or with regard to who was responsible for the success (Study 2).</p>
            <p>We examined the use of event studies in management research and found that there was inadequate attention paid to theoretical and research design issues. This lack of attention may lead to false inferences regarding the significance of the events and the validity of the theories being tested. To illustrate the extent of this problem, we attempted to replicate three recent studies. To guide authors and reviewers, we outline procedures for appropriate use of the event study method.</p>

            <p>Drawing on propositions from social identity theory and signaling theory, we hypothesized that firms' corporate social performance (CSP) is related positively to their reputations and to their attractiveness as employers. Results indicate that independent ratings of CSP are related to firms' reputations and attractiveness as employers, suggesting that a firm's CSP may provide a competitive advantage in attracting applicants. Such results add to the growing literature suggesting that CSP may provide firms with competitive advantages.</p>
            <p>Interorganizational links--cooperative relationships among distinct but related organizations--are believed to enhance innovative processes in organizations. We conceptualize various types of interorganizational links as opportunities for learning and resource sharing in the pursuit of innovation. A study of over 400 California hospitals over ten years found considerable support for the relationship between interorganizational links and innovation. Structural, institutional, and resource-based links were all strongly related to innovation in hospital services and technologies.</p>
            <p>This study examined the impact of strategic similarities between target and bidder firms on changes in postmerger performance. Set in the U.S. banking industry, the empirical examination shows that mergers between banks exhibiting similar strategic characteristics result in better performance than those involving strategically dissimilar banks.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Results of a systematic replication of studies by Dearborn and Simon and by Walsh suggest that differences in their conclusions resulted from differences in their experimental procedures. Managers are broader perceivers when they are encouraged to identify more problems. Also, contrary to Walsh's and others' theories, in this replication belief structure did not mediate the relationship between functional experience and selective perception. In addition, predominantly negative relationships were found between areas of experience and perceptions, indicating that functional experience may produce selective imperception as well as selective perception.</p>

            <p>This study identifies job self-efficacy as a moderating variable that may determine whether job control contributes positively or negative to coping with work stressors. Data from two samples (health professionals and an occupationally diverse group) demonstrated similar interactions between demands, control, and self-efficacy predicting blood pressure. These results may reconcile the previous inconsistent and largely method-bound support for Karasek's job demands-control model and suggest that efforts to improve job self-efficacy may be as important to reducing the cardiovascular consequences of job stress as efforts to enhance control.</p>
            <p>We tested several hypotheses derived from an extended version of Shamir, House, and Arthur's (1993) theory of charismatic leadership. We used three different samples of subordinates to assess leader behavior, individual-level correlates, and unit-level correlates, respectively. We also examined the effects of charismatic behaviors and unit-level correlates on superiors' assessments of leaders' performance. The findings provide only very partial support for the theory and indicate a need for greater sensitivity to the multiple constituencies of leaders in theories and studies of charismatic leadership in organizations.</p>
            <p>We tested hypotheses concerning the effectiveness of three strategies for breaking conflict spirals in negotiations. We also investigated the relationship between outcomes and the relative frequency of reciprocated contentious communications. Results confirmed the hypotheses, showing that extreme distributive outcomes are related to the relative frequency of reciprocated contentious communications and that conflict spirals can be stopped by various communication strategies. Theoretical and practical implications for managing contentious negotiations are discussed.</p>
            <p>This study examined the effect of human and social capital upon firm dissolution with data from a population of Dutch accounting firms for the period 1880-1990. Human capital was captured by firm-level proxies for firm tenure, industry experience, and graduate education. The social capital proxy was professionals' ties to potential clients. Human and social capital strongly predicted firm dissolution, and effects depended on their specificity (uniqueness) and nonappropriability (the ownership status of that capital). Findings suggest an integration of the resource-based view of the firm and organizational ecology and a concomitant stimulant for future research along these lines.</p>
            <p>Using distinctiveness theory, this research showed that the relative rarity of a group in a social context tended to promote members' use of that group as a basis for shared identity and social interaction. Relative to majority group members, racial minorities and women in a master of business administration cohort were more likely to make identity and friendship choices within-group. The marginalization of racial minorities in the friendship network resulted both from exclusionary pressures and from minority individuals' own preferences for same-race friends. By contrast, the marginalization of women resulted more from exclusionary pressures than from their preferences for woman friends.</p>
            <p>This study explored the use of clique analysis for explaining network effectiveness. In data from networks of mental health agencies in three cities, effectiveness, measured as client outcomes, was negatively related to the integration of full networks. In contrast, effectiveness was positively related to integration among small cliques of agencies when these cliques had overlapping links through both reciprocated referrals and case coordination. The findings have implications for both theory and research, demonstrating the value of studying network clique structure and developing clique-based explanations of network behavior and outcomes.</p>
            <p>Using data collected from multiple respondents in all the business units of a large multinational electronics company, we examined the relationships both among the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital and between those dimensions and the patterns of resource exchange and product innovation within the company. Social interaction, a manifestation of the structural dimension of social capital, and trust, a manifestation of its relational dimension, were significantly related to the extent of interunit resource exchange, which in turn had a significant effect on product innovation.</p>
            <p>Previous group and team literature suggests three behaviors--information collection and transfer, task prioritization, and task distribution--as pivotal in groups' adaptation to nonroutine events. The results of a study in which airline crews engaged in a high-workload flight simulation indicated that although the frequencies of two of the three behaviors were not significantly associated with crews' performance, the timing of key adaptive behaviors was thus associated. Only the frequency of information collection activities had a positive association with performance, and the amount of time taken to engage in adaptive responses after nonroutine events had a negative association with it.</p>
            <p>It is argued that the effects of group efficacy (a group's belief regarding its ability to perform effectively) are complex and moderated by several contingency factors. Findings from two intercultural studies support the contingency approach. When task uncertainty was high, team members worked independently, and collectivism was low, group efficacy was not related to group effectiveness. In contrast, when task uncertainty was low, team members worked interdependently, and collectivism was high, the relationship between group efficacy and group effectiveness was positive. Implications for group-level social cognitive theory are discussed.</p>

            <p>Experiences identified by channel expansion theory as contributing to media-use knowledge bases were hypothesized to be positively related to the perceived richness of a communications channel. We investigated the hypotheses, using electronic mail as the channel, in both a cross-sectional and a multiwave study. Results varied for types of experience and generally supported channel expansion theory. Channel use, perceived social influence, and the dynamic nature of richness perceptions were also investigated. Implications of these findings are discussed.</p>
            <p>We redirect research attention on multimarket contact from its consequences to its antecedents. Our empirical examination of the evolution of dyadic multimarket contacts among California commuter airlines from 1979 through 1984 reveals that multimarket contact arises from chance market contacts among competitors pursuing un-coordinated strategies, trait-based imitation unrelated to multimarket contact, vicarious learning related to multimarket contact, and strategic attempts to develop multimarket contact based on insight gained through experiential learning.</p>

            <p>We offer a rationale for a link between capital scarcity and franchising. Predictions respectively based on agency theory and the capital scarcity hypothesis were tested among 91 restaurant chains. Our specific focus was on whether or not variables based on capital scarcity could explain variance in firms' franchising decisions beyond what was explained by agency variables. The latter were significant predictors of franchising, and the capital scarcity variables explained additional variance, indicating that capital is among the resources related to franchising.</p>

            <p>We manipulated transformational and transactional leadership styles and compared them in individual and group task conditions to determine whether they had different impacts on individualists and collectivists performing a brainstorming task. Results showed that collectivists with a transformational leader generated more ideas, but individualists generated more ideas with a transactional leader. Group performance was generally higher than that of individuals working alone. However, contrary to expectations, collectivists generated more ideas that required fundamental organizational changes when working alone.</p>
            <p>In this study, we examined the links between leadership style, the use of humor, and two measures of performance. Results indicated that leadership style was moderated by the use of humor in its relationship with individual and unit-level performance. Implications for further research on the use of humor by leaders are discussed.</p>
            <p>
            <p>A tremendous amount of research has explored the relationship between managerial pay and firm performance. We argue that this research has generally been limited because it ignores other criteria that can be used to determine managerial pay, as well as the influence of a firm's governance structure and various contingencies. Our analysis leads to a general framework for research on executive pay. This framework is used to evaluate the present state of research in this field and the contribution of the six papers in this special research forum, and to identify directions for further research.</p>
            <p>Using panel data on large, publicly traded U.K. companies gathered between 1991 and 1994, we examined the role of board control and remuneration committees in determining management compensation. Board monitoring, measured in terms of the proportion of nonexecutive directors on a board and the presence of remuneration committees and CEO duality, had only a limited effect on the level of top management pay. An important conclusion was that top management pay and corporate performance are more aligned in companies with outsider-dominated boards and remuneration committees.</p>

            <p>Using the complementary lenses of information-processing and agency theories, this study tests the proposition that the complexity resulting from a firm's degree of internationalization will be accommodated by its governance structure. Results from a sample of large U.S. firms support this perspective, suggesting that firms manage and cope with the information-processing demands and agency issues arising from internationalization through higher, longer-term CEO pay, larger top management teams, and the separation of chairperson and CEO positions.</p>

            <p>The idea that managerial discretion--defined as latitude of action--may be an important determinant of CEO compensation has been recognized for some time. However, in spite of considerable work that has implicitly invoked related ideas on the sources of potential managerial contribution, a formal test of the discretion hypothesis has yet to be conducted. In addition, few studies have tested the performance consequences of CEO pay. In a sample of Fortune 1,000 firms, we found support for both a main effect of managerial discretion on CEO pay and a contingency effect, whereby firm performance is higher when discretion and pay are aligned than when they are not.</p>

            <p>This study investigated the influence of institutional investors on CEO compensation policy. Results suggest that institutional owners that have only an investment relationship with a firm influence compensation in accordance with shareholder preferences to (1) lower its level and (2) increase the proportion of long-term incentives in total compensation. However, institutions that depend on a firm for their own business are not able to influence compensation in this manner. This study extends prior research by supporting the viewpoint that the nature of ownership in a firm is an important determinant of CEO compensation.</p>

            <p>Extant research examining the relationship between a firm's board and its CEO's compensation has focused primarily on the composition of the board-at-large. However, it may be the nature of the compensation committee, not the board as a whole, that is at issue. This study was a longitudinal assessment of the relationship between the composition of a firm's compensation committee and multiple measurements of CEO compensation. We found no evidence that "captured" directors led to greater levels of, or changes in, CEO compensation. These findings may suggest the consideration of theories other than agency theory as explanations for the continued focus on board independence.</p>

            <p>We argue that compensation committees will pay executives at least at the going rate and that deviations from that rate will influence subsequent pay. In a sample of large U.K. companies, we estimated whether asymmetric responses to pay anomalies explained executive pay. All three of our pay anomaly measures were statistically related to subsequent pay. Moreover, there was significant nonlinear adjustment toward the going rate for underpaid executives.</p>

            <p>The explosion of knowledge production within business and other organizations poses a critical challenge to current modes of teaching and research within our business schools. We need to consider new strategic positions closer to the knowledge production being carried on within the organizations we study, without assuming that immediate relevance is our primary objective. The academic advantage, in my opinion, still lies in generalization and abstraction.</p>
            <p>Causal ambiguity protects distinctive competencies from imitation but might increase a firm's vulnerability to substitution. We suggest that firms can manage this tension by identifying the causes of superior performance and using this knowledge to make their commitments to key stakeholders more credible. Credible commitment allows a firm to influence its stakeholders and thereby simultaneously delay substitution and control the threat of imitation.</p>

            <p>Many systems migrate toward increasing or decreasing modularity, yet no explicit causal models exist to explain this process. In this article I build a general theory of modular systems, drawing on systems research from many disciplines, and then use this general theory to derive a model of interfirm product modularity, including testable research propositions. The product model provides a valuable tool for predicting technological trajectories, and it demonstrates how the general theory can be applied to specific systems.</p>

            <p>In an effort to clarify the literature on work exhaustion (or job burnout), I integrate causal attribution research and the burnout and exhaustion literature to develop an attributional model of work exhaustion consequences. With this model I suggest that individuals experiencing work exhaustion will not exhibit all of the job attitudes and behaviors found to correlate with exhaustion. Rather, individuals are likely to experience a subset of these, depending on their perceptions regarding the cause of exhaustion. I also discuss implications and directions for future research.</p>

            <p>Management journals often contain heated discussions about disciplinary approaches, or how and whether to legitimate different kinds of research. I classify nine such approaches in a typology. These varied approaches arise because none can fully accommodate the conflicting scientific and pragmatic pressures placed on academic research. The airing of these views, however, helps members of the discipline meet their responsibility to re-evaluate the value of existing research and new currents in an ongoing fashion.</p>

            <p>In research on sexual harassment, authors have given little attention to sexual harassers. We present an actor-focused model of sexual harassment interactions. In the model, which is based on interpersonal aggression research, we frame sexual harassment as one form of behavior an actor might choose for pursuing valued goals. The model is interactive, in that we discuss the effects of sexually harassing actions on the target's perceptions, motives, and behavioral response choice. We also provide propositions to guide future research.</p>

            <p>Organizations must be ambidextrous to successfully develop new products-they must act creatively as well as collectively. However, how to do this is not clear. I analyze this problem and review the literature in terms of two opposing forces: the first increases the quantity and quality of ideas, information, and knowledge available for creative action while the second integrates these things into collective action. I then model these forces to explain how the coexistence of contradictory structural elements and processes increases the probability of successful development.</p>

            <p>Although the existence of Japanese corporate networks and Japanese management practices has been substantiated in the management literature, explanations for their origins are lacking. I illustrate that the Japanese family provides an institutional logic for Japanese corporate networks and Japanese management practices. Furthermore, the historical actions of individuals in Japanese corporations are indicative of a strategy to sustain and nurture their social capital-a strategy that might explain the historical persistence of this family logic.</p>

            <p>We contrast two hybrid dispute resolution procedures (arbitration-mediation and mediation-arbitration) that involve using mediation and arbitration in different sequences. The former's strengths stem from lowering disputant expectations and enhancing cooperative behaviors during the mediation phase. The latter procedure likely will be less costly and time consuming, enhance fairness judgments, and produce greater compliance to arbitrated decisions. We argue that the greatest benefit from arbitration-mediation is that it should encourage disputants to settle differences themselves.</p>

            <p>Although gossip is widespread, seldom has it been a topic of management research. Here we build a conceptual model of workplace gossip and its effects on the power of employees who initiate it. After defining and distinguishing among different kinds of workplace gossip, we develop propositions about the effect of that gossip on gossipers' expert, referent, reward, and coercive power. We then suggest how moderators may shape those effects and discuss implications of the model.</p>

            <p>Although failure in entrepreneurship is pervasive, theory often reflects an equally pervasive antifailure bias. Here, I use real options reasoning to develop a more balanced perspective on the role of entrepreneurial failure in wealth creation, which emphasizes managing uncertainty by pursuing high-variance outcomes but investing only if conditions are favorable. This can increase profit potential while containing costs. I also offer propositions that suggest how gains from entrepreneurship may be maximized and losses mitigated.</p>

            <p>Recognizing that not all employees possess knowledge and skills that are of equal strategic importance, we draw on the resource-based view of the firm, human capital theory, and transaction cost economics to develop a human resource architecture of four different employment modes: internal development, acquisition, contracting, and alliance. We use this architecture to derive research questions for studying the relationships among employment modes, employment relationships, human resource configurations, and criteria for competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>We extend transaction cost economics by arguing that prior contractual commitments made by a firm can limit its ability to differentiate or change its governance arrangements in the future-a condition we term governance inseparability. Changes in bargaining power between a firm and its exchange partners also can result in governance inseparability. Consequently, governance choice may be more particularistic than the current version of transaction cost economics allows. We provide several testable propositions.</p>

After discussing three types of complexity (of the legitimating environment, the organization, and the process of legitimation) that MNEs typically face, we explore their effects on MNE legitimacy. In particular, we distinguish between the legitimacy of the MNE as a whole and that of its parts, and we develop propositions that include issues of internal versus external legitimacy and positive and negative legitimacy spillovers.</p>

            <p>Previous research on organizational citizenship behavior suggests that employees who engage in such behavior are "good soldiers," acting selflessly on behalf of their organizations. However, such behaviors also may be impression enhancing and self-serving. In this article I provide a framework showing how impression-management concerns may motivate citizenship behavior and address the consequences of citizenship in this context, as well as the interaction of impression-management motives with motives identified in previous research on citizenship. Finally, I discuss the methodological issues associated with isolating self-serving from other-serving motivation and implications for future theory development.</p>

Trust is an important part of strategic choice, and managers who develop optimal trust in relationships with stakeholders will improve firm performance. We offer a definition of optimal trust, develop propositions based on the definition, and include indicators managers might use to assess whether trust is optimal in relationships with various stakeholders.</p>

            <p>The resource-based view of the firm contributes to the management of product development by highlighting how different functional and integrative capabilities affect process efficiency and product effectiveness. Here, I first review this evidence and then add it to past findings on this topic to form an agent-resource model, which provides a more analytical understanding of product development performance drivers. I also discuss the model in order to direct future research on such relevant issues as the creation, the utilization, and the capitalization of capabilities.</p>

A greater emphasis on spatial variation in organizational environments allows the fitness strategy of polymorphism to be developed more adequately and multiunit expressions of the specialist and generalist strategies to be added to the theory. I develop a set of testable propositions regarding the specific environmental conditions for the success of each strategy and consider research and managerial implications.</p>

            <p>In this article we offer a view that suggests that a firm's critical resources may span firm boundaries and may be embedded in interfirm resources and routines. We argue that an increasingly important unit of analysis for understanding competitive advantage is the relationship between firms and identify four potential sources of interorganizational competitive advantage: (1) relation-specific assets, (2) knowledgesharing routines, (3) complementary resources/capabilities, and (4) effective governance. We examine each of these potential sources of rent in detail, identifying key subprocesses, and also discuss the isolating mechanisms that serve to preserve relational rents. Finally, we discuss how the relational view may offer normative prescriptions for firm-level strategies that contradict the prescriptions offered by those with a resource-based view or industry structure view.</p>

            <p>Contingent work is an increasingly integral part of the world of work, affecting firms' abilities to accumulate knowledge, create value, and establish competitive advantage. Although its growing use reflects a belief that firms can reduce cost structures and increase strategic flexibility, we suggest that in certain contexts, such as dynamic environments, contingent work can be a means of accumulating and creating valuable knowledge. We also discuss implications for other forms of permeable organizational boundaries.</p>

            <p>We define organizational improvisation as the degree to which the composition and execution of an action converge in time, and we examine the theoretical potential of this definition. We then propose that both organizational procedural memory (skill knowledge) and declarative memory (fact knowledge) moderate improvisation's impact on organizational outcomes in distinct ways. We also suggest that improvisation influences organizational memory by (1) generating experiments and (2) permitting the development of higher-level competency in improvisation. Contemporary technological changes related to the nature of organizational memory intensify the salience of these issues.</p>
            <p>Firms competing in multiple markets find equilibrium through spheres of influence and mutual forbearance, but imperfect competitive information may give one firm an incentive to influence rivals' behavior and uncover information. We suggest that a firm's resource allocations can divert competitors' resource allocations, enhancing the firm's own sphere of influence without precipitating a destructive all-out war. We define the stratagems thrust, feint, and gambit and conclude that corporate strategy decisions can only be imperfectly understood if competitive interaction is not taken into account.</p>

            <p>We propose a taxonomy of multidimensional constructs based on the relations between the construct and its dimensions. Multidimensional constructs that exist at deeper levels than their dimensions we term latent model. We call constructs formed as algebraic functions of their dimensions aggregate model, whereas constructs formed as different profiles of dimensional characteristics we term profile model. We discuss the nature of multidimensional constructs defined under these models and their operationalizations in empirical research.</p>
            <p>In this article we present a framework for studying the concepts of fit and flexibility in the field of strategic human resource management (HRM), focusing on HRM practices, employee skills, and employee behaviors, and review past conceptual and empirical work within that framework. We present a model of strategic HRM and use this model to explore the concepts of fit and flexibility as they apply to strategic HRM. After applying the concepts of resource and coordination flexibility to strategic HRM, we discuss the implications of the framework for both the practice of and research on strategic HRM.</p>
            <p>In this article we develop a model of subsidiary evolution to shed light on the processes that drive changes in a subsidiary's activities and its underlying capabilities. We see subsidiary evolution as (1) the enhancement/depletion of capabilities in the subsidiary, coupled with (2) an explicit change in the subsidiary's charter. Building on this definition, we analyze the interaction between capability and charter change and identify five generic subsidiary evolution processes, developing propositions around the underlying drivers for each process.</p>

            <p>We extend and adapt a model of group memory to organizations. Using this extended model, we identify information management challenges of the next century and suggest that organizations can address these challenges by locating a large portion of their information-processing activities outside their formal boundaries, by adopting novel socialization tactics, and by focusing on the management of soft knowledge forms (e.g., tacit knowledge, judgment, and intuitive abilities). Whereas current theories increasingly equate information management with the management of information technology, we argue that information technology needs to be complemented by organization-level processes related to organizational memory.</p>
            <p>When seeking to influence firm decision making, what types of influence strategies do stakeholders have available, and what determines which type the stakeholders choose to use? In this article I use resource dependence theory to investigate these two questions. I propose that the resource relationship (who is dependent on whom) determines which of the four types of strategies identified in this article will be used: direct withholding, direct usage, indirect withholding, or indirect usage.</p>
            <p>We describe two divergent approaches to stakeholder theory-a social science approach and a normative ethics approach-and examine their differences and similarities. Since neither approach is complete without the other, we propose a new way of theorizing about organizations: the development of normatively and instrumentally sound convergent stakeholder theory. This form of theory is explicitly and unabashedly normative, demonstrating how managers can create morally sound approaches to business and make them work.</p>

            <p>We address gaps in the multilevel organizational theory development literature by critically examining the structure and function of collective constructs. Structure emerges from interaction and can, over time, come to influence systems of interaction. Functions represent the causal outputs of constructs and provide a mechanism for integrating constructs across levels. We then discuss implications arising from this perspective and present a set of guidelines for multilevel research and theory development.</p>
            <p>We present a model of CEO charismatic leadership in organizations and show how such leadership can, through levels of management and analysis, impact organizational performance. We integrate levels issues relevant to the conceptualization of theoretical constructs and their relationships, measurement, and echelons, and develop the concept of close versus distant leadership as a means of understanding the dynamics of CEO leadership. We also include a consideration of possible alternative levels of analysis at which the constructs in our model may be operating.</p>

Uncovering and then relaxing these assumptions allow us to extend the literature with an alternative but complementary model of how creativity unfolds in complex, large-scale, and long-duration organizational projects. We build on the paradigm of sensemaking and propose a multilevel model of creativity that, as its defining feature, examines how periodic organizational crises reframe the negotiated order of belief structures about creativity.</p>

            <p>To examine the phenomenon of the transnational transfer of strategic organizational practices within multinational companies, I use a cross-disciplinary approach. After conceptualizing the success of a transfer as the institutionalization of the practice at the recipient unit, I develop a multilevel model of transfer success, based on the notion of the contextual embeddedness of the process of transfer. I propose that three sets of factors at three levels-country, organization, and individual-affect transfer success reflecting social, organizational, and relational embeddedness. Finally, I discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.</p>
            <p>I present a multilevel theory of emotion and change, which focuses on attributes of emotional intelligence at the individual level and emotional capability at the organizational level. Emotional intelligence facilitates individual adaptation and change, and emotional capability increases the likelihood for organizations to realize radical change. I also present a mesolevel framework relating emotion-attending behaviors to three dynamics of change: receptivity, mobilization, and learning. These behaviors, which I term emotional dynamics, constitute the organization's emotional capability.</p>

We discuss examples and implications of the approach for theory building.</p>
            <p>Recent models of unethical behavior have begun to examine the combination of characteristics of individuals, issues, and organizations. We extend this examination by addressing a largely ignored perspective that focuses on the relationships among actors. Drawing on social network analysis, we generate propositions concerning types of relationships (strength, multiplexity, asymmetry, and status) and the structure of relationships (structural holes, centrality, and density). We also consider the combination of the type and structure of relationships and how this embeddedness perspective relates to social contagion and conspiracies.</p>

            <p>In this article we present a model of the processes whereby social actors use impression management behaviors to create and maintain identities as charismatic leaders. Using a dramaturgical and interactive perspective, we examine the roles that the environment, actor (leader), and audience (followers) play in defining the situation and in jointly constructing a "charismatic relationship." We assert that charismatic leaders' self-systems and situational assessments guide their efforts to manage follower impressions of them, their vision, and their organization. Framing, scripting, staging, and performing constitute the basic phases in this dramaturgical process. Exemplification and promotion are identified as the primary strategies invoked by leaders during the performing phase to construct a charismatic image; facework is employed to protect this image when it is threatened. We also consider how and why followers come to attribute charisma to, identify strongly with, and direct high levels of positive affect toward the leader. We advance research propositions along with methodological recommendations for testing them, and we conclude by considering the model's practical implications for developing charismatic relationships that empower followers and facilitate the attainment of socially beneficial goals.</p>
            <p>The impact of organizational crises has never been stronger. Yet previous research on crisis management lacks adequate integration. In this article we attempt to integrate and build upon current knowledge to create a multidisciplinary approach to crisis management research, using psychological, social-political, and technological-structural research perspectives. We offer definitions of organizational crisis and crisis management, as well as a framework that depicts the crisis management process and researchable propositions for the integration of these perspectives. We also suggest implications for research and practice.</p>
            <p>Companies in many countries complain of the unfairness of having to compete against foreign rivals facing more lenient environmental regulations. In this article I examine the competitive conditions for firms in such a position. I outline the development of a new pollution-reduction paradigm centered on lowering costs by reducing pollution and, using twelve scenarios of international differences in environmental regulatory regimes faced by first movers and imitators, make propositions on which factors are important to the maintainability of these advantages.</p>

            <p>Firms often adopt strategies in spite of mixed evidence about the strategy's performance and of evidence that the strategy leads to inefficient outcomes. Here, we describe the conditions prompting the spread of inefficient strategies through a population of firms, as well as the characteristics of individual firms that affect their propensity to adopt efficient and inefficient strategies. We focus on one pattern that appears common to strategic adoptions: a pattern where the number of unsuccessful adoptions exceeds the number of successful adoptions. We note how the failure to consider diffusion patterns in empirical strategic research limits use of that research as a source of prescriptive theory.</p>
            <p>An examination of the diverse literature on organizational decline shows that there is disagreement regarding the effects of decline on innovation. Some research streams suggest that organizational decline interferes with an organization's capacity to innovate, whereas other research implies just the opposite: organizational decline stimulates innovation. In this article we integrate the inconsistent perspectives and findings in these research streams by developing a contingency model. The model identifies variables at the environmental, organizational, and individual levels of analysis that determine whether organizational decline inhibits or stimulates innovation. We summarize the moderating effects of these variables with empirically testable propositions and discuss implications of the framework for future research and management practice.</p>

            <p>Building on agency and prospect theory views, we construct, in this article, a behavioral agency model of executive risk taking. In the model we combine elements of internal corporate governance with problem framing to explain executive risk-taking behavior. The model suggests that executive risk taking varies across and within different forms of monitoring and that agents may exhibit risk-seeking as well as risk-averse behaviors. We develop specific propositions that combine monitoring with performance and the framing of strategic problems to explain executive choices of strategic risk. The resulting propositions enhance and extend the agency-based corporate governance literature on executive risk taking.</p>

            <p>In previous literature on employee selection, leadership, and organizational trust, scholars have identified integrity as a central aspect of work behavior. However, despite important contributions, their work often has confused integrity with other concepts (especially honesty and conscientiousness) and has treated integrity as either a morally neutral or relativistic phenomenon. The philosophy of "Objectivism" solves these problems by providing a definition of integrity that distinguishes the term from related concepts and by integrating integrity into an objective code of morality. I discuss the implications of this perspective for the study of integrity in organizations.</p>

            <p>This article challenges Becker's objectivist account of integrity in organizations. Although existing approaches to workplace integrity are flawed by conceptual and methodological inconsistencies, an objectivist analysis is unable to resolve these problems and raises new concerns. We develop three lines of argument. First, we critique objectivism as a philosophical system of questionable legitimacy and coherence. Second, we argue that the fundamental objectivist principle of rational egoism is inferior to existing theories of business ethics as a means of defining moral behavior in organizations. Third, we contend that the objectivist account of integrity understates the role of social power as a determinant of organizational choices and outcomes.</p>
            <p>In their critique of Becker's article on integrity in organizations, Barry and Stephens argue that the Objectivist approach is illegitimate, inferior to subjectivist perspectives of business ethics, and unmindful of the role of social power in organizations. We respond to these criticisms by demonstrating that Barry and Stephens' critique rests upon the fallacious argument from authority, a misunderstanding of altruism and egoism, and a failure to distinguish between economic and social power. In so doing, we explain why the Objectivist perspective is valid and why it is superior to subjective, relativistic misconceptions of integrity.</p>
            <p>We propose that employees craft their jobs by changing cognitive, task, and/or relational boundaries to shape interactions and relationships with others at work. These altered task and relational configurations change the design and social environment of the job, which, in turn, alters work meanings and work identity. We offer a model of job crafting that specifies (1) the individual motivations that spark this activity, (2) how opportunities to job craft and how individual work orientations determine the forms job crafting takes, and (3) its likely individual and organizational effects.</p>
            <p>We evaluate how changes in information use affect agency relationships. Information asymmetry redistributes value, but imperfect monitoring also encourages agents to take inefficient actions to influence this redistribution, thereby reducing joint agency value. Changing focus, from minimizing principals' costs to maximizing joint agency value, we argue that more monitoring is not always better, and we explore, through a six-sector framework, how more extensive use of information benefits (or damages) value creation and affects its distribution.</p>

            <p>Power in organizations is a fluid social construction subject to multiple interpretations. The extensive literature on power provides insights about the antecedents and consequences of power at the individual and group levels but does not provide a model tracing the linkages between them and describing how power develops and is transferred between individuals and groups. In this article we describe some of the conditions necessary for power identities and reputations to develop and transfer effectively between individuals and groups in organizations.</p>
            <p>In economics and management theories, scholars have traditionally assumed the existence of artifacts such as firms/organizations and markets. I argue that an explanation for the creation of such artifacts requires the notion of effectuation. Causation rests on a logic of prediction, effectuation on the logic of control. I illustrate effectuation through business examples and realistic thought experiments, examine its connections with existing theories and empirical evidence, and offer a list of testable propositions for future empirical work.</p>
            <p>
            <p>We introduce social networks theory and methods as a way of understanding mentoring in the current career context. We first introduce a typology of "developmental networks" using core concepts from social networks theory-network diversity and tie strength-to view mentoring as a multiple relationship phenomenon. We then propose a framework illustrating factors that shape developmental network structures and offer propositions focusing on the developmental consequences for individuals having different types of developmental networks in their careers. We conclude with strategies both for testing our propositions and for researching multiple developmental relationships further.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Creativity research has a long and illustrious history, yet the assumptions on which it is based have not been questioned. Most researchers assume that creativity is a unitary construct, hindering a fuller understanding of the phenomenon. Here I argue against homogeneity through the development of a matrix of four creativity types: responsive, expected, contributory, and proactive. Implications include highlighting an imbalance in research, differences in processes, and predictors for the various types, as well as newly considering methodologies.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>Building upon the observation that individuals feel ownership toward a variety of targets, we suggest that under certain conditions, organizational members can develop feelings of ownership toward the organization and various organizational factors. We define psychological ownership, identify its "roots" and the primary "routes" through which it develops, and propose certain organizational outcomes. We discuss the conceptual distinctiveness of psychological ownership from a set of related constructs and suggest some theoretical and managerial implications of our theory.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework to describe value creation as a process comprising resource combinations and exchanges and use the framework to show how organizations in general, and business firms in particular, interact with markets to create economic value for themselves, for their members, and for society. The theory offers an explanation of why neither a market nor a firm, by itself, can achieve adaptive efficiency and why institutional pluralism contributes to the process of economic development.</p>

            <p>The identity literature suggests that the stigma of "dirty work" threatens the ability of occupational members to construct an esteem-enhancing social identity. However, research indicates much the opposite, creating a puzzle we attempt to answer. We argue that the stigma of dirty work fosters development of a strong occupational or workgroup culture, which fosters (1) ideological reframing, recalibrating, and refocusing and (2) selective social comparisons and differential weighting of outsiders' views. These defense mechanisms transform the meaning of "dirt" and moderate the impact of social perceptions of dirtiness.</p>

            <p>We introduce an interlocking self-regulation model of negotiation. A central tenet of this new model is that negotiation is both external (getting the other side to offer what you want) and internal (deciding whether to want what the other side offers). We discuss important issues implicit in this model, and we propose strategies by which negotiators reduce discrepancies between standards and offers, incorporating research on the role of attributions.</p>
            <p>In this article we introduce the concept of workplace incivility and explain how incivility can potentially spiral into increasingly intense aggressive behaviors. To gain an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie an "incivility spiral," we examine what happens at key points: the starting and tipping points. Furthermore, we describe several factors that can facilitate the occurrence and escalation of an incivility spiral and the secondary spirals that can result. We offer research propositions and discuss implications of workplace incivility for researchers and practitioners.</p>
            <p>Technology implementation is complex and often unpredictable. Although previous research describes mechanisms related to the social construction of technology and technology use in organizations, researchers have focused little on the inputs to these models. In this article I attempt to fill this void by examining triggers for initial user sensemaking. The prediction of sensemaking should enhance the application of theories, such as adaptive structuration, and inform the management of technology through greater anticipation of user understanding.</p>

            <p>Recent research developments underscore the need for research on the processes that link board demography with firm performance. In this article we develop a model of board processes by integrating the literature on boards of directors with the literature on group dynamics and workgroup effectiveness. The resulting model illuminates the complexity of board dynamics and paves the way for future empirical research that expands and refines our understanding of what makes boards effective.</p>
            <p>In this article I address the lack of integration of normative and descriptive approaches to business and society and the problems posed for coherent theory development. I reformulate corporate social performance topics according to a research strategy aimed at moving inquiry beyond problems of integration. I then demonstrate the potential for a normative-descriptive unification, and follow this with implications for future research.</p>
            <p>Although interest in organizational learning has grown dramatically in recent years, a general theory of organizational learning has remained elusive. We identify renewal of the overall enterprise as the underlying phenomenon of interest and organizational learning as a principal means to this end. With this perspective we develop a framework for the process of organizational learning, presenting organizational learning as four processes-intuiting, interpreting, integrating, and institutionalizing-linking the individual, group, and organizational levels.</p>
            <p>We introduce the construct of organizational social capital and develop a model of its components and consequences. Organizational social capital is defined as a resource reflecting the character of social relations within the organization. It is realized through members' levels of collective goal orientation and shared trust, which create value by facilitating successful collective action. We discuss employment practices as primary mechanisms by which social capital is fostered or discouraged within organizations.</p>

            <p>We propose a framework of risk premium that offers a resolution to CAPM's challenge to the field of strategy. Our core assumption is that investors bear firm-specific risk because they are not as diversified and markets not as perfect as CAPM assumes. We therefore hypothesize that investors require lower risk premiums from firms that are able to reduce firm-specific risk, and we ground this prediction on theories from information economics, risk management, and strategy, as well as recent empirical challenges to CAPM.</p>

            <p>We discuss individual differences in the meanings people attach to money. We briefly review the management theory and research that describe money as a motivator and how attitudes about pay influence behavior. Following this is a section on money as an individual-difference construct, how it is defined and measured, and to what it is related. We conclude the article with a discussion of how an understanding of this individual-difference variable can further our theory, research, and practice in the areas of human resource management and organizational behavior.</p>
            <p>In this article we examine the meaning of team process. We first define team process in the context of a multiphase episodic framework related to goal accomplishment, arguing that teams are multitasking units that perform multiple processes simultaneously and sequentially to orchestrate goal-directed taskwork. We then advance a taxonomy of team process dimensions synthesized from previous research and theorizing, a taxonomy that reflects our time-based conceptual framework. We conclude with implications for future research and application.</p>
            <p>Examining the ways in which affect impacts the trust that develops between members of dissimilar groups broadens the study of trust development. People's perceptions of their own interdependence with other groups influence both their beliefs about group members' trustworthiness and their affect for group members. I propose that this affect, in turn, influences interpersonal trust development through multiple paths: cognitive, motivational, and behavioral. Using literature on social information processing, emotion, and intergroup behavior, I elucidate the social and affective context of trust development.</p>

            <p>We integrate theory and research from disparate areas to develop a descriptive stakeholder theory. We (1) show that at any given organizational life cycle stage, certain stakeholders, because of their potential to satisfy critical organizational needs, will be more important than others; (2) identify specific stakeholders likely to become more or less important as an organization evolves from one stage to the next; and (3) propose that the strategy an organization uses to deal with each stakeholder will depend on the importance of that stakeholder to the organization relative to other stakeholders.</p>
            <p>We seek to enrich organizational inquiry by introducing an additional level of abstraction based on theory complexity. We develop four levels of theory complexity and anchor each with well-established theoretical frameworks and research streams. After identifying the contingency approach as the simplest, we progress through cycles and competing values approaches and arrive at the chaos perspective as the most complex. We use research on time orientations, polychronicity, and entrainment to illustrate the utility of such a ladder of theoretical complexity in provoking alternative research lenses and inquiry.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Firms are embedded in networks of cooperative relationships that influence the flow of resources among them. Dynamic resource flows and differentiated structural positions lead to asymmetries and influence firms' competitive behavior toward others in the network. We develop a multilevel conceptual model relating key network properties to competitive action and response. A structural embeddedness perspective with a focus on simultaneous cooperation and competition advances our understanding of competitive dynamics and provides intriguing possibilities for future research.</p>

            <p>We propose a supplemental perspective, based on organizational social capital, for examining the voluntary turnover-organizational performance relationship. We view existing organizational-level theories as those focusing on cost or human capital issues or, rarely, on a balance among these factors. But rapid changes in the nature of work, organizational structures, and interorganizational competitiveness increase the importance of studying the role of social capital in the voluntary turnover-organizational performance relationship. We highlight areas of correspondence and divergence among the various perspectives, discuss implications for various performance measures, and outline several research directions.</p>
            <p>We argue that there are powerful forces in many organizations that cause widespread withholding of information about potential problems or issues by employees. We refer to this collective-level phenomenon as "organizational silence." In our model we identify contextual variables that create conditions conducive to silence and explore the collective sensemaking dynamics that can create the shared perception that speaking up is unwise. We also discuss some of the negative consequences of systemic silence, especially for organizations' ability to change and develop in the context of pluralism.</p>
            <p>Organizational theorists tend to homogenize what is, in reality, a pluralistic world, emphasizing the discovery of unifying principles that lend organizational focus, legitimacy, and identity while downplaying some of the complexity that pluralism often entails. In their original formulation, most organizational theories have richness and depth in modeling pluralistic variety; over time, however, theorizing seems to have purchased parsimony and generality at the cost of accuracy or realism. We revisit the dominant questions from three influential paradigms-strategic management, institutionalism, and organizational identity-and explore alternative theorizing that advantages pluralism.</p>
            <p>We explore two consequences of organizational restructuring that are unanticipated by managers. At the cognitive level of analysis, we propose that organizational restructuring has the unanticipated consequence of producing cognitive order for top executives, and at the environmental level, organizational restructuring has the unanticipated consequence of contributing to long-term environmental turbulence. Both feed back to promote further organizational restructuring, making restructuring a self-reinforcing loop. We derive formal propositions from this theoretical framework, discuss issues in testing the propositions, and specify implications for future theory building and management practice.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Organizations and individual employees increasingly are pursuing change in how work is organized, how it is managed, and in who is carrying it out. At the same time, there are numerous individual, organizational, and societal forces promoting stability in work and employment relations. Here we discuss change and stability and the forces pushing individuals and organizations to pursue both. We argue that some level of tension between stability and change is an inevitable part of organizational life and that this tension must characterize research on work and organizations.</p>
            <p>"Paradox" appears increasingly in organization studies, often to describe conflicting demands, opposing perspectives, or seemingly illogical findings. This article helps researchers move beyond labeling-to explore paradoxes and contribute insights more in tune with organizational complexity and ambiguity. I first develop a framework that clarifies the nature of paradoxical tensions, reinforcing cycles, and their management. Using this framework, I then review studies in which paradoxes spurred by change and plurality are investigated. I conclude by outlining strategies for identifying and representing paradox, addressing implications for research.</p>
            <p>The study of the classics in our field is important to the themes of this special issue because (1) the classics have shaped the world we live in; (2) studying the classics enlarges our theoretical alternatives; and (3) the critique of taken-for-granted assumptions enshrined in the classics can spur change, development, and pluralism. We briefly review a selection of classic writings to illustrate how change and pluralism have been presented as threats, as opportunities for the management of innovation, and as intrinsic aspects of management.</p>
            <p>In this article I review studies of resistance to change and advocate new research based on a reconceptualization of individual responses to change as multidimensional attitudes. A challenging question for research and practice arises: How can we balance the organizational need to foster ambivalent attitudes toward change and the individual need to minimize the potentially debilitating effects of ambivalence? I conclude by highlighting the importance of examining the evolution of employee responses to change over time and the need to understand responses to change proposals that emerge from bottom-up, egalitarian change processes.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Concepts of time vary dramatically across individuals and cultures. We draw from work in anthropology, psychology, sociology, and management to identify five time dimensions that guide our review and discussion of dynamic strategic management research. Although strategy researchers incorporate time in many ways, they generally ignore a subjective view of time and the temporal perceptions of actors in their models. We conclude by suggesting how strategy researchers and practitioners can incorporate an unambiguous and multifaceted view of time explicitly into their work.</p>

            <p>It has been argued persuasively that social networks hold relevance for economic action. Yet, in light of the taken-for-granted role of prices, it is crucial to specify when and how social networks influence the efficiency of economic actions taken by actors oriented primarily, as business firms tend to be, toward economic objectives. In this article I contend that when actors need to but cannot, independently or via market mechanisms, cost-effectively ascertain the identity and reliability of potential exchange partners, then scope exists for social networks to appreciably and systematically influence efficiency.</p>
            <p>
            <p>In recent research scholars have addressed the issue of an individual's behavior in feedback-seeking activity and, except in scant studies, have virtually ignored the role of culture in this area. In this article we explore four cultural syndromes, based on past research, to form a cross-cultural model of feedback-seeking behavior. We advance propositions for the study of culture as a moderator to feedback-seeking behavior.</p>
            <p>We present a synthesis of the general dimensions of organizational culture used most commonly in extant research and outline how these general dimensions correspond to the specific values and beliefs underlying total quality management (TQM) practice (a comprehensive change initiative). We argue that the relationship between culture and implementation of new behaviors and practices has not been adequately explored because of the lack of a comprehensive framework for defining and measuring organizational cultures. Our framework presents a necessary step in moving toward culture as a useful explanatory concept in organizational research.</p>

            <p>Despite the increasing popularity of group pay-for-performance plans, relatively little theory exists regarding the dynamics of these plans. We integrate goal setting, pay plan characteristics, and group factors to explain and predict the effectiveness of what we call "open-goal" group pay plans. We introduce spontaneous goal setting as a process explanation and propose antecedents that affect a group's propensity to set goals, the goal level chosen, and goal commitment. Finally, we discuss implications of our propositions for future research.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Trust, which occurs at the organizational and interpersonal levels, is generally believed to be important for the success of interfirm relationships. We explore the effects of interaction between the two types of trust on negotiators' motivation to solve problems of adaptation in relational contracting. What we find is that too much trust is as bad as too little. Solutions are furthest from optimal when both organizational and interpersonal trust are high or both are low.</p>

            <p>Recent thinking about top management has been influenced by alternative models of man.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Economic approaches to governance such as agency theory tend to assume some form of homo-economicus, which depict subordinates as individualistic, opportunistic, and self-serving. Alternatively, sociological and psychological approaches to governance such as stewardship theory depict subordinates as collectivists, pro-organizational, and trustworthy. Through this research, we attempt to reconcile the differences between these assumptions by proposing a model based upon the subordinate's psychological attributes and the organization's situational characteristics.</p>
            <p>We provide a comprehensive review of the strategic change literature from the perspective of three theoretical lenses: the rational, learning, and cognitive lenses. We identify empirical patterns and discuss the theoretical and methodological contributions and limitations of each lens. We address the key methodological issues that hamper integration of these lenses and develop an integrative framework that builds on their theoretical synergies. We note this framework's contributions and present two research questions that provide an agenda for future research.</p>
            <p>
            <p>In the existing transformational leadership research, little attention has been paid to contextual influences on transformational leadership. To more fully understand transformational leadership as an organizational process, researchers must study it in relation to a contextual framework. We discuss how four contextual factors affect organizational receptivity to transformational leadership. We also examine how the configuration of these factors may be used as a framework for enriching transformational leadership research.</p>
            <p>In this article, the notion of syncretic rent-seeking behavior is proposed to explain how firms generate economic rents through competition and cooperation. Previously, competition and cooperation have been viewed largely as opposite ends of a single continuum. By conceptualizing competition and cooperation as distinct but interrelated dimensions, we develop a four-cell typology of rent-seeking strategic behaviors. Propositions linking syncretic rent-seeking behavior, organizational competencies, and business performance are offered to guide future theory development and research efforts.</p>
            <p>New business startups with venture capital backing depend on mutual cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, but little is known about what makes these relationships work. The present article considers the implicit similarities between entrepreneurventure capitalist relationships and the Prisoner's Dilemma framework, using this paradigm to develop a conceptual model of entrepreneurs' and venture capitalists' decisions to cooperate. The model is used to generate a number of testable propositions concerning long-term cooperation between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Implications of the model for researchers, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists are discussed, and the paper concludes by examining implications of the entrepreneur-venture capitalist context for the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma framework.</p>
            <p>Although the high rate of instability of international joint ventures (IJVs) has been well documented, the underlying reasons for the instability need clarification. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework for instability of IJVs grounded in a bargaining power and dependence perspective. Instability is defined as a major change in partner relationship status that is unplanned and premature from one or both partners' perspectives. The core argument is that the instability of IJVs is associated with shifts in partner bargaining power. Shifts in the balance of bargaining power occur when partners of an IJV acquire sufficient knowledge and skills to eliminate a partner dependency and make the IJV bargain obsolete. Our primary focus is on the acquisition of local knowledge by the foreign partner and the impact that this acquisition of knowledge has on the stability of the IJV.</p>

            <p>
            <p>The author posits that the joint venture (JV) form of governance imposes a greater burden of bargaining and political influence costs than is present in a hierarchy. The JV's incremental costs derive from shared sovereignty and incomplete contracting. The magnitude of those costs is related to parental differences, factionalism, and task interdependence in the top management team (TMT), and dynamism in the task environment. The costs are argued to undermine the quality of TMT decision making, thereby negatively affecting organizational adaptation, performance, and survival.</p>
            <p>The psychological contract held by an employee consists of beliefs about the reciprocal obligations between that employee and his or her organization. Violation refers to the feelings of anger and betrayal that are often experienced when an employee believes that the organization has failed to fulfill one or more of those obligations. This article provides a model outlining the psychological sensemaking processes preceding an employee's experience of psychological contract violation. It also identifies factors that affect those processes with the aim of encouraging future empirical research.</p>
            <p>Qualities that are culturally associated with females are appearing in descriptions of managerial work in the texts of contemporary writers, and these texts function as carriers of a feminine ethos to practicing managers. The article describes a mechanism-management writings-used to disseminate and legitimate a management idea. It examines the nature of the rhetoric used in management writings and the implication of authors' failure to label the idea by its name: feminization. This "feminization" is discussed from both women's voice and poststructuralist perspectives. Implications for management theorizing and future research are described.</p>
            <p>Stakeholder theory has been a popular heuristic for describing the management environment for years, but it has not attained full theoretical status. Our aim in this article is to contribute to a theory of stakeholder identification and salience based on stakeholders possessing one or more of three relationship attributes: power, legitimacy, and urgency. By combining these attributes, we generate a typology of stakeholders, propositions concerning their salience to managers of the firm, and research and management implications.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Stakeholder theory development has increased in recent years, in part because of its emphasis on explaining and predicting how an organization functions with respect to the relationships and influences existing in its environment. Thus far, most researchers have concentrated on dyadic relationships between individual stakeholders and a focal organization. Using social network analysis, I construct in this article a theory of stakeholder influences, which accommodates multiple, interdependent stakeholder demands and predicts how organizations respond to the simultaneous influence of multiple stakeholders.</p>
            <p>A phenomenon of the last 20 years has been the rapid rise of the network form of governance. This governance form has received significant scholarly attention, but, to date, no comprehensive theory for it has been advanced, and no sufficiently detailed and theoretically consistent definition has appeared. Our objective in this article is to provide a theory that explains under what conditions network governance, rigorously defined, has comparative advantage and is therefore likely to emerge and thrive. Our theory integrates transaction cost economics and social network theories, and, in broad strokes, asserts that the network form of governance is a response to exchange conditions of asset specificity, demand uncertainty, task complexity, and frequency. These exchange conditions drive firms toward structurally embedding their transactions, which enables firms to use social mechanisms for coordinating and safeguarding exchanges. When all of these conditions are in place, the network governance form has advantages over both hierarchy and market solutions in simultaneously adapting, coordinating, and safeguarding exchanges.</p>

            <p>In this article we propose a theoretical model of the dynamics underlying the experiences of women and people of color in demographically diverse decision-making groups. Based upon the framework provided by the model, we then describe the different roles women and people of color may experience in these groups, and we examine the dynamics by which their roles may change over time. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and management practice.</p>

            <p>In this article I extend real options theory to technology positioning projects and specify how the relationship between boundary conditions and uncertainty influences the value of a technology option, as well as the appropriate timing of its exercise. I also take a strategic perspective on uncertainty itself, concluding that option value can be amplified by investments to shift boundaries, ideally in ways that are idiosyncratic to the firm.</p>
            <p>We examine the phenomenon of multiple organizational identities and suggest that they can be managed in organizations by changing the number of (identity plurality) or relationships among (identity synergy) the identities. Using "plurality" and "synergy" as response dimensions, we offer a classification scheme identifying four major types of managerial responses: compartmentalization, deletion, integration, and aggregation. We also suggest several key conditions that may affect the use and appropriateness of these identity management responses and develop a series of propositions for research.</p>

            <p>We develop a model of organizational identity construction that reframes organizational identity within the broader context of manager-stakeholder relationships and more effectively integrates theory on organizational identity and organizational identification. We describe organizational identity as emerging from complex, dynamic, and reciprocal interactions among managers, organizational members, and other stakeholders. The model draws attention to organizational identity as negotiated cognitive images and to the embeddedness of organizational identity within different systems of organizational membership and meaning. Viewing organizational identity from the perspective of manager-stakeholder relationships provides a more parsimonious but more complete theory of organizational identity management.</p>
            <p>Organizational identity usually is portrayed as that which is core, distinctive, and enduring about the character of an organization. We argue that because of the reciprocal interrelationships between identity and image, organizational identity, rather than enduring, is better viewed as a relatively fluid and unstable concept. We further argue that instead of destabilizing an organization, this instability in identity is actually adaptive in accomplishing change. The analysis leads to some provocative, but nonetheless constructive, implications for theory, research, and practice.</p>
            <p>Our present understanding of identification processes poses a serious limitation to diversity research. In this article I present a preliminary model explicating how organizational, task, and reward structures affect the activation of members' personal, relational, and collective identity orientations. I further outline the manner in which the identity orientations of majority and minority individuals link to cognition, affect, and behavior of members of each group, as well as to diversity-related organizational outcomes. Activating a relational identity orientation may promote benefits and inhibit disadvantages associated with diversity. I also discuss apparent theoretical and practical contributions of the model.</p>

            <p>Organizations are prone to ego defenses, such as denial, rationalization, idealization, fantasy, and symbolization, that maintain collective self-esteem and the continuity of existing identity. These defenses are dysfunctional when they militate against necessary organizational change. Maladaptive identity defense mechanisms can be mitigated through processes of organizational learning in the form of critical self-reflexivity and an identity-focused dialogue, which promote attitudes of wisdom.</p>
            <p>Although aspects of social identity theory are familiar to organizational psychologists, its elaboration, through self-categorization theory, of how social categorization and prototype-based depersonalization actually produce social identity effects is less well known. We describe these processes, relate self-categorization theory to social identity theory, describe new theoretical developments in detail, and show how these developments can address a range of organizational phenomena. We discuss cohesion and deviance, leadership, subgroup and sociodemographic structure, and mergers and acquisitions.</p>

            <p>Strategic renewal consists of three subprocesses (competence definition, deployment, and modification). Within each subprocess, the roles of top-, middle- and operating-level managers differ in their time horizon, information requirements, and core values. Dissensus in managers' perceptions about the need for change creates strategic role conflicts within individual managers and between managerial roles. In this article we explain when and where strategic role conflict occurs and how organizational controls may be used to alleviate it.</p>
            <p>Work-family research emphasizes the importance of mechanisms that link work and family. However, these mechanisms typically are described in metaphoric terms poorly suited to rigorous research. In this article we translate work-family linking mechanisms into causal relationships between work and family constructs. For each relationship we explain its sign and causal structure and how it is influenced by personal intent. We show how these respecified linking mechanisms constitute theoretical building blocks for developing comprehensive models of the work-family interface.</p>
            <p>Organizational scholars have studied the impact of employment law on the structure of formal organizations but have given little attention to how law affects everyday life within work organizations. Here we propose a "legal readings model" of how law is received and mobilized by employees. This posits that law within organizations is composed of employees' beliefs about law and mobilization of law, which develop from interaction with employers' law-related actions. Employees' legal readings function much like a prism, redirecting legal rules in multiple and sometimes unanticipated directions.</p>

            <p>To date, the phenomenon of entrepreneurship has lacked a conceptual framework. In this note we draw upon previous research conducted in the different social science disciplines and applied fields of business to create a conceptual framework for the field. With this framework we explain a set of empirical phenomena and predict a set of outcomes not explained or predicted by conceptual frameworks already in existence in other fields.</p>

            <p>To better understand the phenomenon of organizational downsizing, we compare three theoretical perspectives on downsizing: the economic, the institutional, and the sociocognitive. We use the three perspectives to organize the growing empirical literature on downsizing, and we link streams of empirical work to the theoretical perspective that underlies each. With our sociocognitive model, we argue that downsizing has become institutionalized through the collectivization and reification of a "downsizing is effective" schema. We also discuss implications for future theory and research.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>Business practice has been at odds with organizational theory: whereas one managerial "fashion"-downsizing-involves divestiture of human assets, another-learning-advocates investment in human assets. We use a social network frame to consider the impact of downsizing on organizational learning and propose that the effects can be viewed as a nonlinear function of learning network size. From this perspective the potential damage to a firm's learning capacity is greater than headcount ratios imply.</p>
            <p>We present a problem-centered organizing framework of trust, in which prominent conceptualizations of trust and distrust from the organizational and allied social sciences are categorized based on the questions they attempt to answer. The framework we outline here is intended to complement earlier typologies by suggesting alternative strategies for employing the diverse trust literature, identifying questions that could be profitably addressed through interdisciplinary research efforts, and distinguishing disagreements where debate and research would seem to be especially worthwhile from those where such activities would appear to be much less useful.</p>
            <p>In this article we contend that trust can be conceptualized as four distinct and ordered forms-shallow dependence, shallow interdependence, deep dependence, and deep interdependence-determined by the nature of the interdependence between trusting parties. We argue that both the risks that trusting parties assume and the mechanisms for mitigating those risks emerge as a function of the form of interdependence in the relationship. By reviewing research in which trust is a central component, we illustrate the elements of this model and examine its implications.</p>
            <p>We propose a new theoretical framework for understanding simultaneous trust and distrust within relationships, grounded in assumptions of multidimensionality and the inherent tensions of relationships, and we separate this research from prior work grounded in assumptions of unidimensionality and balance. Drawing foundational support for this new framework from recent research on simultaneous positive and negative sentiments and ambivalence, we explore the theoretical and practical significance of the framework for future work on trust and distrust relationships within organizations.</p>
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>The study of trust has occupied scholars from a number of disciplines, who have made limited attempts at integrating the different streams. One reason for lack of integration is that no clear definition of trust exists. In this article we grapple with this issue by going back to first principles to derive a mathematically precise and statistically rigorous definition of trust. In giving a rigorous meaning of trust, we also capture the key elements of the concept as highlighted by various disciplinary lenses. Our definition of trust, although rationally based, is consistent with many of the findings of earlier behavioral and sociological research. Its contribution is in adding precision and richness to our understanding of how trust is created and maintained in various social and economic interactions.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Arguably, the most critical time frame for organizational participants to develop trust is at the beginning of their relationship. Using primarily a cognitive approach, we address factors and processes that enable two organizational parties to form relatively high trust initially. We propose a model of specific relationships among several trust-related constructs and two cognitive processes. The model helps explain the paradoxical finding of high initial trust levels in new organizational relationships.</p>
            <p>Strategic alliances have been recognized as arenas with potential for opportunistic behavior by partners. Hence, a firm needs to have an adequate level of confidence in its partner's cooperative behavior. In this article we examine the notion of confidence in partner cooperation in alliances and suggest that it comes from two distinct sources: trust and control. We make the argument that trust and control are parallel concepts and that their relationship is of a supplementary character in generating confidence. In addition, we suggest that control mechanisms have an impact on trust level and that the trust level moderates the effect of control mechanisms in determining the control level. Finally, we discuss various ways to build trust within strategic alliances and important alliance control mechanisms.</p>
            <p>In many approaches to interpersonal and organizational trust, researchers focus on employees' perceptions that their managers are trustworthy. We turn the tables, however, and examine the antecedents of managerial trustworthy behavior and the challenge of initiating trust. Drawing on agency and social exchange theories, we present an exchange relationship framework that identifies organizational, relational, and individual factors that encourage or constrain managerial trustworthy behavior.</p>
            <p>
            <p>In this article we analyze the way that trust evolves in organizations and how it influences cooperation and teamwork. We propose that the experience of trust is determined by the interplay of people's values, attitudes, and moods and emotions. Then, using the perspective of symbolic interactionism, we examine how trust evolves and changes over time, describing two distinct states or forms of trust: conditional and unconditional. We look, too, at the factors involved in the dissolution of trust. Finally, we explore the relationship between trust and an important component of organizational performance and competitive advantage: interpersonal cooperation and teamwork.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Examples of violations or betrayals of trust in organizations abound. Despite growing concern in organizations, relatively little theory exists regarding the dynamics of trust violations from the perpetrator's (rather than the victim's) perspective. We adopt the betrayer's perspective in this article and, drawing from multiple literatures, offer a conceptualization of betrayal, differentiating it from deviant and antisocial behaviors in organizations. Next, we propose a typology of betrayal before focusing on the most common form: opportunistic betrayal. We then develop a model of its antecedents and moderators and highlight the intrapersonal-, interpersonal-, and organization-level characteristics of the model's components. We end by discussing implications for theory, research, and practice.</p>
            <p>In this article we develop a stress-based framework of survivors' responses to downsizing. First, we synthesize prior research findings into a typology of survivor responses delineated by two underlying dimensions: constructive/destructive and active/passive. Drawing on Lazarus's theory of stress, we then posit that how survivors appraise the downsizing will shape their responses to it. We argue that trust and justice influence primary appraisal and facilitate more constructive responses because they reduce the extent to which organizational downsizing is evaluated as a threat. Likewise, we argue that empowerment and work redesign influence secondary appraisal and facilitate more active responses because they enhance survivors' assessments of their capacity to cope with the threat. Finally, we discuss contributions of the framework and implications for research and practice.</p>
            <p>Trust is a critical component of interfirm relations, and scholars have pointed to Japan as an environment where trusting business relationships flourish. Rather than viewing trust as an inherent and driving force in Japanese interfirm relations, we propose that a combination of institutional and societal sanctioning mechanisms is largely responsible for the apparently trust-induced cooperation there. Our examination of buyer-supplier relations in the Japanese auto industry demonstrates the important role of these sanctions. We recommend focusing on sanctions in further explorations of interfirm trust.</p>
            <p>Increasingly, researchers from a variety of business disciplines are finding that trust can lower transaction costs, facilitate interorganizational relationships, and enhance manager-subordinate relationships. At the same time, we see a growing trend toward globalization-in establishing alliances, managing and hiring employees, and entering new markets. These trends suggest a need to view the concept of trust from the perspective of national culture. Drawing on theories from several disciplines, we develop a framework that identifies and describes five cognitive trust-building processes that help explain how trust develops in business contexts. We include a series of research propositions demonstrating how societal norms and values influence application of the trust-building processes, and we discuss implications for theory and practice.</p>

            <p>We focus on everyday role transitions involving home, work, and other places. Transitions are boundary-crossing activities, where one exits and enters roles by surmounting role boundaries. Roles can be arrayed on a continuum, spanning high segmentation to high integration. Segmentation decreases role blurring but increases the magnitude of change, rendering boundary crossing more difficult; crossing often is facilitated by rites of passage. Integration decreases the magnitude of change but increases blurring, rendering boundary creation and maintenance more difficult; this challenge often is surmounted by boundary work.</p>

            <p>Despite considerable practitioner interest in gainsharing compensation programs, understanding how gainsharing works and, thus, how to improve it in practice is hampered by a lack of a theoretical foundation upon which to build empirically testable models. We use a risk-sharing framework to develop a model of gainsharing that we hope will provide this missing theoretical foundation. In our model we develop propositions that highlight the differences between group-wide and individual incentive arrangements and that establish boundary conditions for a theory of gainsharing.</p>

            <p>Privatization has become a popular strategy to promote economic development in emerging, developing, and developed economies. Despite its popularity, little attention has been devoted to examination of the organizational and managerial implications of privatization or to the effect of privatization on companies' ability to innovate and engage in entrepreneurial activities. In this article we discuss privatization's increasing importance and present a model that links privatization to a firm's entrepreneurial activities. We conclude with a discussion of issues that we believe deserve scholars' attention in theory development and subsequent empirical examination.</p>
            <p>Why are so many emerging economies privatizing state-owned enterprises, and how does that affect their performance? I propose a dynamic multilevel model to answer these questions. Firm-level arguments need to be complemented by industry- and country-level arguments to explain why some enterprises are privatized but not others. Similarly, changes in firm governance resulting from privatization are only one determinant of postprivatization performance; changes in industry structure, regulation, and country-level variables are as important. Furthermore, changes introduced at all three levels in one round of reform influence the context within which subsequent privatizations occur.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Firm-level responses to privatization have not been widely studied. Drawing from industrial organization economics, the resource-based view, and interorganizational cooperative strategy, I develop an integrated theory to show how privatization encourages early entry; how delayed market liberalization reinforces first mover benefits; and how firms with specialized resources, an entrepreneurial orientation, and local partner collaborations gain postprivatization competitive advantage. I construct a model and provide case illustrations to support the theoretical development, discuss implications of the research, propose methods to test the model, and make suggestions for future inquiry.</p>
            <p>Conceptualizing privatization as the shift from one institutional template to another, we draw on the related literature of institutional theory and script development to explore the interactive effects of actors' behavioral scripts and institutional templates. In so doing, we address microlevel aspects of the macroinstitutional change of privatization and advance our understanding of the role of public sector managers in the privatization process.</p>
            <p>Agency and public choice theories of privatization indicate that a privatized firm's performance will improve on average, but they do not include an explanation of the observed variance in this result. We argue that organizational and contextual variables need to be considered in order to explain that variance. We develop a model and propositions about the changes that privatization triggers in the firm's management, governance structure, goals, incentives, control, strategy, and organization.</p>

            <p>We examine the upside potential of privatization of both publicly traded firms and state-owned enterprises through the lens of agency and entrepreneurial cognition theory. In addition to managerial incentives, we argue that significant entrepreneurial progress in made through a cognitive shift from a managerial to an entrepreneurial mindset. The two perspectives provide a framework for understanding buyouts and how managerial incentives and individual cognition, considered in tandem, effectively expand managerial discretion and thereby stimulate upside growth.</p>

            <p>Organizational transformation in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe is qualitatively different from that observed in the West because of concomitant upheaval in the institutional context. Drawing on organizational change theory, organizational learning theory, and institutional theory, I suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between institution-level change and transformative organizational change. By integrating three theoretical perspectives in the conceptual frame-work of this article, I more fully explain organizational transformation in a variety of institutional contexts.</p>
            <p>With ongoing privatization efforts in emerging economies, governments have supported developmental financial institutions (DFIs) to spur entrepreneurial activity. We use stakeholder theory to suggest that postprivatization stakeholders differ in their preference to seek DFI support. We then posit that national developmental priorities influence the DFI's willingness to be involved in the governance of the privatized firm, and we discuss implications of DFI involvement for value creation and entrepreneurship in emerging economies.</p>

            <p>What is the best set of privatization policies to release entrepreneurial endeavors in transition economies? Policies of mass privatization in Central Europe were predicated on the belief that private ownership through securitization of property rights would provide powerful incentives for efficient restructuring. In retrospect, the more radical privatization programs not only failed to achieve the expected restructuring but also hindered the development of entrepreneurial activities. In this article we develop four propositions, arguing that entrepreneurship is better fostered through gradualist policies permitting negotiated solutions to restructuring, as opposed to market-driven reforms.</p>

            <p>The ineffectiveness of several privatized firms within emerging economies underscores the importance of agency theory issues and their impact on the privatization-performance relationship. We argue that weak governance and limited protection of minority shareholders intensify traditional principal-agent problems (perquisite consumption and entrenchment) and create unique agency problems (expropriation). We suggest that postprivatization performance can be enhanced by using appropriate ownership, management, and corporate structures that mitigate agency problems in the context of weak governance, and we highlight avenues for research.</p>

            <p>Transaction cost and institutional theories are integrated in order to enhance understanding of the process by which entities adopt new organizational designs. By grafting cognitive and institutional constraints into the comparative-efficiency framework favored by transaction cost theorists, theorists using the constrained-efficiency framework demonstrate both how efficiency-seeking organizations may be biased in favor of current designs and those that are legitimated within their institutional contexts. The article closes by overlaying the constrained-efficiency framework onto the discussion about the evolution of the M-form of organization, as well as suggesting empirical and simulation strategies consistent with the logic of the constrained-efficiency framework.</p>
            <p>Resource-based theorists argue that human assets can be a source of sustainable advantage because tacit knowledge and social complexity are hard to imitate. However, these desirable attributes cause dilemmas that may prevent firms from generating an advantage. This article develops a framework for analyzing and coping with these challenges. Although the problem arises from the strategy literature, the solutions are drawn from the organizational behavior, human resource management, human capital, and professions literatures. Finally, I examine implications for how insights from these diverse literatures can be integrated to guide future strategy research.</p>

            <p>Theorists have often acknowledged the importance of equifinality in organization design, and, in recent years, several studies have demonstrated the concept empirically. This article exposes the assumptions regarding function and structure that underlie contingency theory and develops a functional equivalence view of design. By examining the degree of conflict in functional demands together with the latitude of structural options available, we reveal and describe three different types of equifinality: suboptimal, tradeoff, and configurational. The functional equivalence approach implies a different agenda and emphasis for research on structure and design and has normative implications for how managers should design to achieve performance.</p>

After introducing several key narrative concepts, we discuss the challenges strategists have faced in making strategic discourse both credible and novel and consider how strategic narratives may change within the "virtual" organization of the future. We also provide a number of narrativist-oriented research questions and methodological suggestions.</p>
            <p>Drawing selectively from the often countervailing currents of postmodernism, we argue for an epistemology that combines a skepticism toward metanarrative with a commitment to rigorous standards of enquiry in pursuit of radical challenges to accepted knowledge. We discuss five problematics concerned with normal science, truth, representation, style, and generalizability, and we provide examples of postmodern approaches to classic data sets, local knowledge, eclectic sources, and the counterintuitive. In this article we seek to provoke an ongoing conversation concerning the potential of postmodernism for revolutionizing organizational research.</p>

            <p>A power perspective is used to examine the linkage between diversity and mentorship in work organizations. Sociological perspectives on power and minority group relations are used to develop and operationalize the construct of diversified mentoring relationships in organizations. The article examines behavioral and perceptual processes underlying diversified mentoring relationships and explores the relationship between diversified mentoring relationships and other work relationships. The consequences associated with diversified and homogeneous relationships are examined using a dyadic approach. The article closes by offering research propositions and discussing several implications.</p>

            <p>Theory supporting the key premise of the leader-member exchange (LMX) approach to leadership, that leaders differentiate between subordinates, has not been fully developed. We address this deficiency by (a) returning LMX research to its historical roots in exchange processes by introducing a framework for understanding relationship quality that is based on reciprocity, and (b) extending the traditional domain of LMX research beyond the formal leader-subordinate relationship in order to offer a more complete explanation of the differentiation process. We employ insights derived from social network analysis to describe how social structure facilitates the exchange processes through which leaders assist in incorporating some members into the inner life of an organization but exclude others.</p>
            <p>This article focuses on "schooling" in organization theory: the process through which new schools of thought become established as distinct, legitimate theoretical frameworks. We argue that evolving schools of thought must display a combination of novelty, continuity, and scope to achieve school status. We describe these attributes and discuss their role in promoting the detection and assimilation of a school's intellectual products, as well as the creation of a stream of empirical research. We derive eight testable propositions from our theoretical model and discuss implications for future research.</p>
            <p>In this article we first reflect on the significant and positive impact of postmodernism for organizational theorizing during the past decade. Through several examples we point to contributions that poststructuralist perspectives have brought to the field. Finally, we consider four contemporary theoretical tendencies-feminist poststructuralist theorizing, postcolonial analyses, actor-network theory, and narrative approaches to knowledge-as heirs (apparent) of the postmodern turn for organizational theorizing past postmodernism.</p>
            <p>Multiparadigm approaches aid exploration of particularly complex and paradoxical phenomena by helping theorists employ disparate theoretical perspectives. In this article we provide an extensive guide to multiparadigm exemplars and then link their varied approaches within a metatriangulation theory-building strategy. Our process addresses the challenges theorists face as they select a research topic, collect and analyze data, theorize, and evaluate resulting theory using multiple paradigms. A concluding discussion of the advantages, limitations, and potential applications of metatriangulation positions it within the wider realm of organization theory.</p>
            <p>In this article I describe and compare a number of alternative generic strategies for the analysis of process data, looking at the consequences of these strategies for emerging theories. I evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the strategies in terms of their capacity to generate theory that is accurate, parsimonious, general, and useful and suggest that method and theory are inextricably intertwined, that multiple strategies are often advisable, and that no analysis strategy will produce theory without an uncodifiable creative leap, however small. Finally, I argue that there is room in the organizational research literature for more openness within the academic community toward a variety of forms of coupling between theory and data.</p>

            <p>Narrative is especially relevant to the analysis of organizational processes because people do not simply tell stories-they enact them. Narrative data have surface features that are useful for description, but explanatory process theories must be based on deeper structures that are not directly observable. To address this problem and to facilitate better process theory, in this article I use concepts from narrative theory to create a framework for analyzing structural features in narrative data.</p>
            <p>A critical specification lacking from much theory and research on organizations is that of time scale. Specification of the relevant time scale is as critical as the specification of the appropriate level or unit of analysis, a concept to which it is related. We define and explore five types of time scales and consider their implications for both the social constructionist and positivist approaches. Using examples from strategy and organizational theory, we show how the choice of time scale has important implications for the development of theory.</p>

            <p>We show how the thinness of abstract concepts in thought experiments may provide advantages typically associated with thick description. In addition, we show how the thin abstraction of thought experiments allows for the isolation and manipulation of important variables-a process that parallels the design features of actual experiments and, thus, also casts such empirical methodologies in a new light as modeling input to (rather than their data as output from) theorizing. We consider the implications of this type of theorizing for frame breaking and advancing conceptual developments, such as seen in recent work on trust.</p>

            <p>In this article we assess, from a critical realist perspective, the role played by replication in theory development. We first present a concise review of critical realism and then reply to the objection that replication is not possible in the social sciences. We go on to classify replications into six types along two dimensions. Finally, we present a detailed argument for the significance of replication in social science research and propose a multifocal pattern of knowledge accumulation to be integrated with the scattered pattern commonly found in organizational science.</p>
            <p>We analyze forms of synergy between emic and etic approaches to research on culture and cognition. Drawing on the justice judgment literature, we describe dynamics through which the two approaches stimulate each other's progress. Moreover, we delineate ways in which integrative emic/etic frameworks overcome limitations of narrower frameworks in modeling culture and cognition. Finally, we identify advantages of integrative frameworks in guiding responses to the diverse justice sensitivities in international organizations.</p>

            <p>In this article we use the concept of the organizational field to examine how recent developments in the institutional environment of business schools may be affecting student attitudes toward the behavioral sciences in business schools. Based on this analysis, we propose a number of ways in which recognition of changing logics in the organizational field, combined with a model of teaching as bricolage, might be used to enhance the effectiveness of behavioral science instruction in business schools.</p>

            <p>In this article we examine two general approaches to political action (transactional and relational), two levels of participation (individual and collective), and three types of generic political strategies (information, financial incentive, and constituency building), thus presenting a comprehensive taxonomy of political strategies. In addition, we identify firm and institutional variables that affect the likelihood of making specific decisions within the formulation model. The result is a decision-tree model of political strategy formulation that integrates and extends prior diffused work.</p>

            <p>Sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists believe that much about behavior has deep evolutionary roots. We employ this emerging paradigm about the origins of human nature to explain social behavior and emergent social structures. Using the work of socioecologists and ethologists, we connect these social structures with features of the resource context. Although still controversial, using biological evolution to help explain (social) behaviors holds significant potential for advancing the organizational sciences.</p>

            <p>The field of organizational behavior includes the study of how individuals organize and manage conflict among themselves. Less visible has been the study of conflicts occurring within individuals. We propose that one form of intrapersonal conflict is the result of tension between what people want to do versus what they think they should do. We argue that this want/should distinction helps to explain the "multiple-selves" phenomenon and a recently discovered group of preference reversals noted in behavioral decision and organizational behavior research. We develop a history of knowledge on intrapersonal conflict, discuss how conflicts between what one wants to do and what one should do result in inconsistent behavior, connect this pattern of inconsistency to recent literature on joint versus separate preference reversals, and outline prescriptions for the management of intrapersonal conflict.</p>
            <p>Scholars of the theory of the firm have begun to emphasize the sources and conditions of what has been described as "the organizational advantage," rather than focus on the causes and consequences of market failure. Typically, researchers see such organizational advantage as accruing from the particular capabilities organizations have for creating and sharing knowledge. In this article we seek to contribute to this body of work by developing the following arguments: (1) social capital facilitates the creation of new intellectual capital; (2) organizations, as institutional settings, are conducive to the development of high levels of social capital; and (3) it is because of their more dense social capital that firms, within certain limits, have an advantage over markets in creating and sharing intellectual capital. We present a model that incorporates this overall argument in the form of a series of hypothesized relationships between different dimensions of social capital and the main mechanisms and processes necessary for the creation of intellectual capital.</p>

            <p>Technology markets often exhibit extreme path dependency, enabling random or idiosyncratic events to have dramatic effects on technology success or failure. However, these effects accrue in an ordered way: by impacting a set of factors that have predictable influences on technology adoption. Since firm strategy also impacts these factors, technology adoption is neither wholly random nor beyond the firm's control. In this article I build a model of these factors by integrating economics, strategy, and marketing research. The model yields important implications for the strategic development and deployment of technology.</p>

            <p>Studies of cooperation are abundant in the social sciences, but organizational researchers are calling for integrating the numerous conceptions of cooperation and meeting the new challenges of cultural differences. In this article we develop a culturally contingent model of cooperation. We differentiate various mechanisms from cooperative behaviors and theorize about how culture affects behavioral cooperation through mechanism selection or modification. Delineating cultural effects, we derive patterned differences in the instrumental and expressive motives of individualists and collectivists and propose six culturally contrasting cooperation mechanisms. Finally, we discuss directions for future research and consider implications for practice.</p>

            <p>In this article we explore theoretical explanations of managers' decisions about flexible benefit plans. First, we examine the adoption and design of flexible benefit plans through four theoretic lenses: (1) institutional, (2) resource dependence, (3) agency, and (4) transaction cost. We then integrate the relevant insights gained from these theories into a more complete model and derive propositions for future research. Finally, we generalize the insights gained from exploring a specific innovation to broader questions surrounding decisions about other human resource innovations.</p>

            <p>In this article we address issues of diversity within organizational groups by discussing and summarizing previous approaches and by introducing a new variable-faultlines-which depends on the alignment of individual member characteristics. By analyzing a group's faultlines, we focus attention on the underlying patterns of group member characteristics, which can be an important determinant of subgroup conflict, particularly when the group's task is related to one of its faultlines. We discuss the dynamics of faultlines from the early to later stages of a group's development and show how they may be strongest and most likely when diversity of individual member characteristics is moderate.</p>

            <p>What is the nature of the extremely negative attitudes expressed by so many employees toward their organizations? To respond to this question, we introduce the concept of organizational cynicism. We review the literature from several disciplines on this concept and suggest that organizational cynicism is an attitude composed of beliefs, affect, and behavioral tendencies toward an organization. Following our review and conceptualization, we derive implications of this concept and propose a research agenda for organizational cynicism.</p>
            <p>As a potential theory, the elemental resource-based view (RBV) is not currently a theoretical structure. Moreover, RBV proponents have assumed stability in product markets and eschewed determining resources' values. As a perspective for strategic management, imprecise definitions hinder prescription and static approaches relegate causality to a "black box." We outline conceptual challenges for improving this situation, including rigorously formalizing the RBV, answering the causal "how" questions, incorporating the temporal component, and integrating the RBV with demand heterogeneity models.</p>
            <p>Here I examine each of the major issues raised by Priem and Butler (this issue) about my 1991 article and subsequent resource-based research. While it turns out that Priem and Butler's direct criticisms of the 1991 article are unfounded, they do remind resource-based researchers of some important requirements of this kind of research. I also discuss some important issues not raised by Priem and Butler-the resolutions of which will be necessary if a more complete resource-based theory of strategic advantage is to be developed.</p>

We then explore the implications of our assertion (and Barney's agreement) that resource value is indeed determined outside of the RBV.</p>

            <p>We propose that low performer characteristics (cognitive ability, conscientiousness, and job experience) influence peer attributions for low performer behavior (locus of causality, controllability, and stability) and that these attributions influence the form of helping intended to benefit the group (compensating, training, motivating, and rejecting the low performer). Our model complements organizational citizenship behavior research by suggesting a new set of helping antecedents and extends applications of attributional theory by focusing on peer attributions of coworkers.</p>
            <p>Although the Americans with Disabilities Act requires most employers to provide reasonable accommodation, there is reason to believe that people with disabilities are often unwilling to make such requests. We therefore focus on factors influencing the requester's likelihood of seeking an accommodation. By drawing upon the theories of planned behavior, help-seeking, and distributive justice, we propose a framework identifying several salient beliefs that may influence request likelihood and then explore the role of select situational characteristics in shaping these beliefs as a way to more fully understand the requester's assessment process.</p>
            <p>I present a model of when and how coworkers judge the distributive fairness of workplace accommodations of employees with disabilities. Fairness judgments are made when accommodations are salient and relevant to coworkers. I thus present factors influencing the salience and relevance of accommodation. I also argue that fairness judgments are based on equity and need rules and therefore explore factors influencing equity comparisons and perceived warrantedness. Finally, I suggest directions and ideas for future research.</p>
            <p>We outline a supply and demand model of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Based on this framework, we hypothesize that a firm's level of CSR will depend on its size, level of diversification, research and development, advertising, government sales, consumer income, labor market conditions, and stage in the industry life cycle. From these hypotheses, we conclude that there is an "ideal" level of CSR, which managers can determine via cost-benefit analysis, and that there is a neutral relationship between CSR and financial performance.</p>

            <p>For many years the primary focus of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex was the production of nuclear materials and weapons, but, with the end of the Cold War, its mission has been changed to one of environmental cleanup. This dramatic shift in mission means that the complex is facing new internal and external problems that are forcing organizational change. In this article we examine the weapons complex through the lens of systems-based models of organization, and we find that the complex has moved from a closed to an open system. We also deduce that by remaining with a rational system, rather than moving to a natural system, the transition to the new mission is being made more difficult than it perhaps should be; this point becomes apparent through discussions on the specific problems that the complex is facing in the related areas of organization-culture change, the public's health-fears, and the management of risk. Our intent in this article is to draw attention to these management and social issues and to identify areas where there is a need for theoretical and empirical research.</p>

            <p>The theory of narcissism can be employed usefully to analyze the dynamics of group and organizational behavior. Just as individuals seek to regulate their self-esteem through such ego-defense mechanisms as denial, rationalization, attributional egotism, sense of entitlement, and ego aggrandizement, which ameliorate anxiety, so too do groups and organizations. An understanding of the behaviors by which groups and organizations regulate self-esteem is important, because it sheds light on the dynamics underlying the legitimacy attributions made by organizational participants. In this article I enlarge and illustrate these arguments.</p>
            <p>Although a significant number of researchers have investigated the diversity and commonality of targets' response strategies to sexual harassment (SH), research systematically exploring those responses has been limited. In this article we present a typology of target responses to SH; identify, through a careful analysis of the existing literature, the potential contextual and individual determinants of responses to SH; present a theoretical framework (supported by the whistle-blowing and stress/coping literatures) of the relationships among those determinants and how they collectively influence responses to SH; and identify a comprehensive set of propositions based on this conceptual framework. We also discuss implications for future research and the impact on organizational policies and procedures.</p>
            <p>As a result of both global competition and company downsizing, multinational firms increasingly are using self-managing work teams (SMWTs) in their foreign affiliates. In this article we identify several cultural values that likely will affect whether employees within those facilities will resist the self-management-related and team-related aspects of SMWTs. Further, we argue that the success of SMWTs is related to the extent to which organizations effectively manage culture-based resistance to SMWTs. We then conclude with theoretical implications and recommendations for managers implementing teams globally.</p>
            <p>In this article I examine those business exchanges in which firms hire professional service organizations and give them limited decision-making authority to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. I frame such exchanges within agency theory perspective and invoke the extant literature on professions to delineate several attributes that make principal-professional exchanges intrinsically distinct from others, such as owner-manager agency. In doing so, I question and complement some key assumptions in agency theory and also discuss explicitly how the study of principal-professional exchanges helps highlight important considerations not addressed in the mainstream theory. I then present an expanded framework that integrates agency theory and the literature on the professions and present several propositions to outline four types of restraints on potential opportunistic behavior of professional agents: (1) self-control, (2) community control, (3) bureaucratic control, and (4) client control. The article ends with theoretical and empirical implications.</p>

            <p>A vast array of organizational innovations and changes are transforming US corporations. Large firms have dramatically downsized, refocused, and vertically disaggregated. They increasingly obtain goods and services, pursue complex development efforts, and exploit horizontal synergies without the aid of formal hierarchy. Large firms are also internally disaggregating into smaller, more autonomous units that are treated much like external subcontractors. The authors argue that these organizational innovations share an important underlying commonalty: economic activity is converging toward exchange involving either internal (within-firm) or external (between-firm) networks of small, autonomous production or service units. Small units and small firms have become the basic building block, the molecular units, of these new forms. Further, exchange among the small, autonomous units is commonly a mix of both market-like and hierarchical features. The authors develop a theoretical explanation for these trends. They argue that disaggregation is motivated by the powerful performance incentives that accompany small size. They further argue that disaggregation is facilitated by recent innovations in information technology, organizational design, and performance measurement that permit the selective intervention of market elements in hierarchy and hierarchical elements in markets. The enhanced ability to intervene selectively necessitates a rethinking of traditional assumptions about the discreteness of governance choices. Innovations in organization, measurement, and technology shift decisions about optimal governance from simple market versus hierarchy choices to choices of an optimal mix of hierarchical and market elements. Consequently, managers and scholars must increasingly view organizations as complex webs of governance arrangements rather than as entities with definable boundaries.</p>
            <p>Information technology (IT) enables a new refinement of the horizontal network organization. We show that IT can be applied to a hybrid form of market and hierarchy, franchising, and demonstrate how the resulting horizontal network organization can be an improved organization form. Specifically, we use IT-enabled "ownership of customers" to refine the horizontal network organization and show how that refinement can alleviate the problem of franchise underinvestment in traditional franchising. In traditional franchising each franchise underinvests relative to investments in an integrated firm because the benefits that accrue to other franchises from its investment (horizontal externalities) are not accounted for in its investment decision. Ownership of customers is a combination of identifying individual customers with individual franchises, monitoring customer transactions across franchises, and transferring benefits between franchises based on those transactions. Because ownership of customers rewards franchises for the beneficial horizontal externalities generated by their investments, the levels of investment that are chosen by franchises may be increased, although not to the levels that would occur in an integrated firm. As long as IT costs are covered, the franchisor is always more profitable and, if necessary, the franchisor and franchisees can be jointly more profitable. Consequently, if profits can be redistributed in lump-sum form, then the franchisor and franchisees can be individually more profitable. The analysis applies to all horizontal organizations where ownership of customers is feasible and where there are sufficient transactions between units for ownership of customers to be worthwhile.</p>
            <p>This paper underscores the importance of examining strategic response to institutional influences in light of hypercompetition. Focusing on the banking industry, which is hypercompetitive and highly institutionalized, affords a unique opportunity to understand how individual corporations in such an industry respond strategically to institutional pressures. We examine critical contingencies arising from hypercompetition that moderate institutional influences on information systems outsourcing in commercial banks. Using data from 226 banks and hierarchical moderated regression analyses, we show that the propensity of banks to conform to or resist institutional pressures depends on the nature of institutional pressures, perceived gain in production economies, financial capacity to resist institutional influences, and transaction cost considerations.</p>
            <p>The authors examine the meaning of control in international joint ventures (IJVs) and the relationships of potential means of control in such organizations to the performance satisfaction of the foreign partner. They propose a conceptual model that provides both a traditional ownership-focused internalization perspective on those issues and an integrated approach combining a broader transaction cost interpretation of control with a resource input-based bargaining power model. A set of simultaneous structural equations with endogenous explanatory variables provides multiple possible paths from various resource and power inputs through different means of control to perceived performance satisfaction. In such a model, intermediate variables act both as dependent and independent variables; thus the complex theoretical interactions of the variables are modeled more comprehensively and realistically than in single-equation models. To test the model and compare the theoretical relationships, the authors used data from a survey of managers in Norwegian multinational firms having at least one IJV. For structural equation modeling with latent variables, they used the LISREL VII program that simultaneously fits the measured variables to the latent variables and provides a maximum likelihood solution for the structural equation system. The results clearly reject the traditional internalization approach to IJV governance that relies strictly on ownership share to delineate degree of control. However, relative resource input has a strong relationship to relative bargaining of the parent companies, which then drives equity share, control over specific activities, and perceptions of overall control of the IJV. That result supports a bargaining-power-based model of IJV control. The relatedness of the strategic resources of the parent and the joint venture also drives specific control, implying that although transaction risk is important to governance, governance is provided by specific control rather than ownership level. Perceptions of performance are strongly and positively related to overall control. Those results suggest that specialized control provides both protection and exploitation of key resource inputs and is gained through increased bargaining power. Higher levels of specific control result in a perception of overall control and thereby satisfaction with perceived levels of IJV performance among foreign parent company managers. Interestingly, traditional exogenous determinants of IJV control and performance such as government mandates, cultural similarity, and international experience levels fail to provide significant effects. Rather, the focus is on endogenous aspects of the parent-IJV relationship, suggesting that the key to parent firm satisfaction with an IJV is control over operations that use key strategic inputs from the parent.</p>
            <p>The thesis I explore in this essay is that organizational members use humorous remarks to discursively construct and organize their cognitive and emotional experiences in and of their organizations. My assumptions are that: (1) organizations are socially constructed through discourse about them (especially managerial discourse), (2) humorous discourse provides a contradiction-centered construction of organizations that operates in the domains of both cognition and emotion, and (3) interpretation of the text of ironic remarks will suggest the processes by which contradictions and their cultural and emotional contexts are socially constructed through discourse. In this essay I use a form of analysis that I developed in relation to humor theory (Mulkay 1988), theories of irony (Brown 1977, Weick and Browning 1986) and Rorty's (1989) concept of the ironic disposition to interpret spontaneous humorous exchanges observed during the regular meetings of a group of middle managers. My interpretations of ironically humorous remarks indicate that the managers in my study constructed at least some of their cognitive and emotional experiences in contradictory ways including: possible/impossible, great/horrible, comic/serious, and up-to-date/unprepared. The interpretations also suggest how, in constructing contradiction, the managers reflexively constructed themselves in relation to their organization. The analysis points to a paradoxical understanding of organizational stability and change and informs a contradiction-centered view of organizations.</p>
            <p>Theories of innovation diffusion no longer focus exclusively on explaining the rate at which innovations diffuse or the sequence in which they are adopted. They also focus on explaining why certain innovations diffuse extensively, becoming de facto standards, whereas others do so partially or not at all. Many of these theories specify a bandwagon process: a positive feedback loop in which increases in the number of adopters create stronger bandwagon pressures, and stronger bandwagon pressures, in turn, cause increases in the number of adopters. Factors affecting if and how many times this feedback loop cycles explain if and how many potential adopters jump on a bandwagon. We argue that one important factor has not yet been incorporated into theories explaining bandwagons' extent: the structure of social networks through which potential adopters of innovations find out information about these innovations which can cause them to adopt these innovations. We advance a theory of how the structure of social networks affects bandwagons' extent. We propose that both the number of network links, as well as small, seemingly insignificant idiosyncracies of their structures, can have very large effects on the extent of an innovation's diffusion among members of a social network.</p>
            <p>As a part of a larger effort to apply formal logic to organization science, we axiomatize the theory of propagation strategies (life history strategies) of Organization Ecology. We provide an axiomatic system in first-order logic that derives the theory's predictions as theorems from a set of underlying assumptions. First-order logic is widely seen as a standard language for the formalization of scientific theories; it couples considerable expressive power with acceptable computational properties. Our axiomatization increases the understanding on the scope and the limits of Organization Ecology, and yields a consistent theory of propagation strategies with a sound explanatory structure.</p>
            <p>A comprehensive model of work-based learning is illustrated combining explicit and tacit forms of knowing and theory and practice modes of learning at both individual and collective levels. The model is designed to bring together epistemic contributions which are typically studied in isolation. The learning types produced from the model represent processes the intersection of which can contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory for integrating learning and work. At the individual level, work-based learning might start with conceptualization which provides practitioners with a means to challenge the assumptions underlying their practice. In experimentation, they engage their conceptual knowledge in such a way that it becomes contextualized or grounded. However, within the world of practice, in applying theoretical criteria or advanced analytical techniques, one confronts technical, cultural, moral, and personal idiosyncrasies which defy categorization. Hence, experience is required to reinforce the tacit knowledge acquired in experimentation. In fact, learning acquired through experience, often referred to as implicit learning, is the foundation for tacit knowledge and can be used to solve problems as well as make reasonable decisions about novel situations. Nevertheless, reflection is required to bring the inherent tacit knowledge of experience to the surface. It thus contributes to the reconstruction of meaning. At the collective level, conceptualization again makes a contribution in informing spontaneous inquiry but is now embedded within the more formal methods of applied science. Scientists seek to describe and explain social reality through the manipulation of theoretical propositions using the rules of hypothetico-deductive logic. The theories of applied science are often not helpful to practitioners, however, unless they are incorporated into practice. This is the purview of action learning wherein real-time experience, especially problems occurring within one's own work setting, constitutes the primary subject matter. As practitioners come together by being involved with one another in action, they may become a community of practice wherein they learn to construct shared understanding amidst confusing and conflicting data. Hence, community of practice returns knowledge back into its context such that groups learn to observe and experiment with their own collective tacit processes in action. Action science is called upon to bring the individuals' and group's mental models, often untested and unexamined, into consciousness. It is a form of "reflection-in-action" which attempts to discover how what one did contributed to an unexpected or expected outcome, taking into account the interplay between theory and practice. Applications of the model can spur conceptual and practical developments that might lead to a comprehensive theory of work-based learning. The discussion takes up such issues as transition links between learning types, their segmentation by function or process, and implications for epistemology. A sample program, incorporating many of the learning types in the model, is demonstrated. The paper argues that all eight types of learning need to be brought into consideration if learners are to achieve proficiency and become critical while learning at work.</p>
            <p>Based on 11 months of participation in a Japanese high-technology factory, our account follows the working lives of 11 engineers involved in the development, building, and servicing of wire bonding machines necessary for the production of semiconductors. We examined how the technologies that structured time and space shaped the identities of the engineers. Despite crises of project development, the engineers sustained a group identity by participating in routines such as daily meetings, by the physical arrangement of the work site, and by team members' identification with the high-technology products they produced. In this system preoccupied with the construction of zero-defect machines, the engineers were vigilant in preventing the structures of work life from unraveling. We looked in detail at one project that linked wire bonder machines with other machines and found that problems with machines were related by the engineers to problems of group interaction. The engineers promoted an isomorphism between the structure of the group and the structure of technological design: the group was mirrored in the high technology it produced.</p>
            <p>In recent years, agency theory has substantially influenced research on corporate governance. Organizational sociologists have critiqued the agency theory model of boards as limited and have studied how the functioning of boards is shaped by structural, political, and cognitive contexts. Building on their work, this paper empirically studies the cultural embeddedness of boards in a nonprofit organization called Medlay. It shows how organizational identity-the members' shared beliefs about the central, enduring, and distinctive characteristics of the organization-influences the construction and enactment of the director's role and shapes interactions among board members and managers. The findings demonstrate that the role of the director is shaped by Medlay's Janus-faced identity, as both a volunteer-driven organization and a family of friends; directors see themselves as vigilant monitors and as friendly, supportive colleagues. The findings also portray how some board members' scrutiny of the budget, including "lavish" travel expenditures, surfaces the contradictions in Medlay's identity, and creates conflicts for directors. Should board members take managers to task and thereby exercise vigilance and uphold the ideal of volunteer control, or should they safeguard the principle of friendship and avoid all conflict? An influential subset of directors and top managers resolved the budget issue and preserved Medlay's identity by using different "face-saving" strategies to make directors feel that they had been vigilant, and to affirm sentiments of cooperation. More generally, this study extends the literature on corporate governance by showing how organizational identity influences the construction and enactment of the director's role. It introduces the idea of "conflicts of commitment," a form of intra-role conflict that arises when directors are besieged by conflicting aspects of the organization's identity. When actions occur that breach the expected role performance of board members, latent contradictions in the organizational identity emerge, and directors are faced with the conflict of upholding one dimension of identity while undermining the other. The study also contributes to research on organizational identity by proposing a model of how organizational and individual identities shape the board role through the processes of identification and action, and how a hybrid identity generates the potential for intra-role conflict.</p>
            <p>The authors investigate the effect of managers' perceptions of two types of transaction-specific investments on their intention to terminate a current interorganizational relationship: (1) the specific knowledge necessary for a manufacturer's representative (rep) to carry out the selling function for a given manufacturer and (2) the specific knowledge reps acquire about their own customer accounts. The extent to which the length of prior relationship strengthens or weakens the hypothesized linkages is also examined. The authors test the hypotheses within the context of distribution channels (i.e., between a manufacturer and its selling agent), which are characteristic of many vertical organizational relationships. The results replicate in an additional setting some prior findings on the influence of transaction-specific investments between two parties directly involved in a relationship. The authors also find that specialized investments by a downstream partner (i.e., a manufacturer's rep) in relationships that are even farther downstream (i.e., customer accounts) can influence a manufacturer's intention to terminate the manufacturer-rep relationship. Moreover, the length of prior relationship between a manufacturer and its rep is shown to moderate this effect.</p>
            <p>Research on corporate illegality spans several distinct literatures and defies ready integration. This article helps to overcome those problems. Analysis of data from 80 U.S. industrial organizations indicates that lower industry profitability is associated with higher frequencies of detected serious violations of federal environmental laws. Organizational profitability, industry concentration, organization size, structural complexity, organizational decentralization, and ethical climate join this variable in statistical interactions also associated with detected instances of serious environmental violations. However, none of those variables are found to be associated with the incidence of detected nonserious violations. These results provide qualified support for a model of corporate illegality in which illegal behaviors are attributable to the interactive effects of motive, opportunity, and choice. They suggest that illegal corporate activities resist simple explanation, and that future research on corporate illegality should concentrate on further development of multivariable models.</p>
            <p>It has been hypothesized in the international joint venture (IJV) literature that partner selection affects interpartner "fit" which in turn influences a synergistic effect on IJV performance. This study investigates the relationship between IJV success and the strategic and organizational traits of local partners. We address this issue in the context of an emerging economy (P.R. China). Newly emerging economies have in recent years become major hosts of direct investment by multinational corporations (MNCs) because these rapidly expanding economies, characterized by an exploding demand previously stifled by ideologically-based government intervention, provide tremendous opportunities which MNCs can preempt. MNCs in such economies, however, face the challenges of structural reform, weak market structure, poorly specified property rights, and institutional uncertainty. Right local partners can help MNCs boost market expansion, obtain insightful information, mitigate operational risks, and provide country-specific knowledge. The analysis of the data obtained from China suggests that both strategic and organizational traits of local partners are significantly associated with some individual dimensions of IJV performance. Among strategic traits, absorptive capacity, product relatedness, and market power are favorable to IJVs' market and financial outcomes. Market power and experience significantly reduce IJVs' operational uncertainties. Of organizational traits, international experience and organizational collaboration are important for IJVs' not only profitability and stability but also local market expansion and export growth. Organizational form and size influence IJVs' local market performance. The findings provided by this study can help MNCs determine what criteria they should use in opting for local partners and what criteria are vital to their goal accomplishment. Those investors seeking local market expansion should select those local partners that have rich market experience, superior market position, high absorptive capacity, and related product diversification with the IJVs. Those seeking profitability and stability should select local firms that have superior international experience, longer organizational collaboration, and greater market power. While MNCs should use appropriate strategic and organizational criteria to select local partners, the host government or local firms can try to make these traits available to attract more stable and profitable foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p>Existing models of ethical decision making cannot yet explain the disparity between what organization members decide is "right" to do in a given situation and what they actually do. The current paper advances these models with the development of a new idea called moral approbation, defined as moral approval from oneself or others. By arguing that people rely on the opinions of their referent groups when deciding how to behave, the paper also explains how organizational or environmental factors can affect individuals' ethical behavior. This theory proposes that individuals consider four factors when determining their own or someone else's level of moral responsibility in a given situation: the severity of the act's consequences, the certainty that the act is moral or immoral, the actor's degree of complicity in the act, and the extent of pressure the actor feels to behave unethically. A moral agent in an organizational predicament uses these four factors to determine the level of moral responsibility that his or her referent group will attribute to him or her. Based on that perceived level of responsibility, he or she will plan a certain course of action and estimate how much moral approbation can be expected from that referent group based on that behavior. The agent then compares this anticipated level of moral approbation to the minimum that he or she can tolerate. If the anticipated moral approbation meets that threshold, the agent is likely to establish a formal intention of behaving according to the projected plan, and is more likely to act in accordance with that plan. On the other hand, if the comparison shows that the threshold will not be met, the actor is likely to rethink his or her course of action and continue to go through the moral approbation process until a plan is developed that will lead to the necessary level of approbation. The moral approbation model begins to fill the theoretical gap between moral judgment and moral action in organizations, with some explicit observations about the effect of organizational influences. These issues are of both scholarly interest and practical concern.</p>
            <p>Various determinants have been proposed to explain the persistence of nationally-bound administrative heritages. In this paper, we propose an overall model that integrates these contingent determinants. Our model is based on historical analysis, a method of theory building that first conceptualizes a model and then utilizes it as an exploratory lens for viewing historical evidence. The originality of our model comes from the theory-based bias that we introduce into the model as a way to avoid the trap of multi-causalism. Specifically, we select a nation's educational system as our model's leading determinant, for educational institutions and particularly schools more than other institutions both shape a nation's beliefs about "how things ought to be done," and transmit those beliefs and practices to successive generations. We draw the theoretical grounding for this bias using a theory of socialization which posits that the schemas that individuals internalize during their early formative stages of development greatly influence the way that they will later construct reality. We found our model to be useful in clarifying the underlying historical reasons why British and French firms rely on different integrative mechanisms when establishing headquarters-subsidiary linkages. Indeed, by analyzing the history of these two nations and the routines and rationalities imposed by their respective set of institutions in the context of our model, we find an overall mosaic, or gestalt, that is fully consistent with their present-day administrative practices. For example, we find that French managers today tend to heavily rely on centralized controls and headquarters intervention because of the influences of a number of key historical elements. These include the way their ancestors dealt with threats of invasion and ethnic diversity; the leadership styles of past French monarchies and elected officials; the manner in which the French colonies were controlled and the French school system organized; and the way the French government responded to economic problems that came from being a late participant in the two industrial revolutions. These also include the philosophies of the revered seventeenth-century French thinkers; the family structures that have existed in France since the middle ages; and the enduring influence of the Catholic ethos. Similarly, we use our model to present a different, yet equally compelling, mosaic image to explain why British managers have tended to rely on an administrative heritage, based on decentralization, "laissez-faire" and autonomy. Finally, and perhaps most important, we show that the explanation we arrived at using this inductive method of theory building is fully consistent with the empirical conclusions we derived using contemporary methods of organization science. In so doing, we demonstrate that these two approaches, when combined, can inform and enrich theory building and thereby lead to a more thorough understanding of organizational phenomena such as administrative heritage.</p>
            <p>Most studies of organizational performance define performance as a dependent variable and seek to identify variables that produce variations in performance. Researchers who study organizational performance in this way typically devote little attention to the complications of using such a formulation to characterize the causal structure of performance phenomena. These complications include the ways in which performance advantage is competitively unstable, the causal complexity surrounding performance, and the limitations of using data based on retrospective recall of informants. Since these complications are well-known and routinely taught, a pattern of acknowledging the difficulties but continuing the practice cannot be attributed exclusively to poor training, lack of intelligence, or low standards. Most researchers understand the difficulties of inferring causal order from the correlations generated by organizational histories, particularly when those correlations may be implicit in the measurement procedures used. We suggest that the persistence of this pattern is due, in part, to the context of organizational research. Organizational researchers live in two worlds. The first demands and rewards speculations about how to improve performance. The second demands and rewards adherence to rigorous standards of scholarship. In its efforts to satisfy these often conflicting demands, the organizational research community sometimes responds by saying that inferences about the causes of performance cannot be made from the data available, and simultaneously goes ahead to make such inferences. We conclude by considering a few virtues and hazards of such a solution to dilemmas involving compelling contradictory imperatives and the generality of the issues involved.</p>
            <p>Positing that organizational phenomena result from both individual human intentionality and natural causes independent of individuals' intended behavior, the need for a quasinatural organization science is identified. The paradigm war is defined in terms of positivism and postpositivism, with the suggestion that a more relevant epistemology might be scientific realism. The current unconstructive paradigm proliferation is seen as resulting from an underlying cause, idiosyncratic organizational microstates, phenomena identified by postmodernists. The article develops quasi-natural organization science as an antidote to multiparadigmaticism by recognizing that mathematically, computationally, and experimentally intense twentieth century natural sciences all have microstate idiosyncrasy assumptions similar to those post-modernists suggest are true of organizational phenomena. By framing a quasi-natural organization science focusing on microstates, my intent is not to deny the relevance of either intentionality and subjectivity or natural science and objectivity. The article attacks the microstate idiosyncrasy problem on four frontiers: micro- and macroevolutionary theory, semantic conception epistemology, analytical mechanics, and complexity theory. The first frontier develops the natural side of quasi-natural organization science to explain natural pattern or order. This "order" arguably results from multi-level coevolutionary behavior in a selectionist competitive context in the form of multi-level selectionist effects. The second frontier reviews the historic role of idealized models, as understood by historical realists and the "semantic conception of theories"-idealized constructs such as point masses or the rational actor assumption-that currently successful sciences, such as physics and economics, drew upon early in their life-cycles to sidestep the idiosyncrasy problem. Organization scientists are encouraged to develop theories in terms of idealized models. The third frontier attends to the role of `instrumental conveniences' as essential constructs in the early life-cycle stages of sciences and the importance of studying rates. For example, a construct such as a pressure vessel acts as a container translating idiosyncratic gas particle movements into a directed pressure stream where particles emerge at some rate. Drawing on Sommerhoff's "directive correlation" concept as an analogous "container" in firms, this section argues that such containers can be used in organizational analysis to translate idiosyncratic microstates into probabilistic rates of occurrence, thereby allowing the use of intrafirm rate models and Hempel's deductive-statistical model of explanation. An example is given showing how human resource variables can be translated into rate concepts and then used in the context of the directive correlation and the deductive statistical model. The fourth frontier draws on complexity theory as a computational/analytical approach that directly incorporates idiosyncrasy by use of dynamical (nonlinear) methods. Complex adaptive systems, kinds of complexity, the causal role of complexity, and levels of adaptive tension likely to foster self-organization are discussed. An example shows how a complexity theory approach differs from a conventional explanation of why participative management decision making styles have failed to proliferate. The combined effect of rate dynamics, statistical mechanics, and dynamical analysis lays the platform for a realist, predictive, and generalizable quasi-natural organization science, thereby offering a possible resolution of the paradigm war. The mitigation of idiosyncrasy effects allows a reemphasis of background laws in organization science, as opposed to the further emphasis of contingent details advocated by post-modernists.</p>
            <p>Using grounded theory development research methods, the authors examine collaborative processes in the global biodiversity preservation domain. The processes examined are those initiated and convened by a subgroup of the Swiss-based International Union for the Conservation of Nature known as the Conservation Breeding Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission. The global collaborative initiatives of the group suggest that extant theory on collaboration may not adequately explain collaborative processes in so complex a domain as global biodiversity preservation. Specifically, the authors suggest that in highly complex domains, effective structuring of collaborative initiatives may take different forms. Propositions about structuring of collaborations in complex domains are derived.</p>
            <p>The authors develop a dynamic model of organization decision making that is motivated by the decision-making process at a multinational chemical firm, given the pseudonym Chemco, that they visited shortly after the Union Carbide explosion in Bhopal, India, and again six years later. Two major decisions were taken by Chemco that could be attributed in large part to the Bhopal disaster: the divestiture of one of its plants and the sale of a business. An analysis of those actions by Chemco underscores the importance of reference points and constraints in influencing organizational choices.</p>
            <p>This paper examines how a decision maker's inability to discern the causal structure that leads to his firm's success or failure (i.e., causal ambiguity) shifts attention away from making the so-called "right" decision toward managing the strategy-making process. For this process, I advocate a calculative experimentation approach that lies somewhere between truly random trial-and-error behavior and planned solutions. To suggest this approach, this paper defines causal ambiguity and proposes a typology of causal ambiguities. The primary distinctions in this typology derive from the knowability of causal structures and inputs to the causal structures, and what is actually known by relevant actors. A simple model of decision making is presented based on a hypothesis-testing approach to problem solving, with tentative rules about the relationships between actions and outcomes being revised in a Bayesian fashion. This paper also considers the circumstances under which causal ambiguity will affect strategy making: in particular, pointing to the overall complexity both within the firm and in its environment. To illustrate the effect of causal ambiguity, I examine the prototypical strategic problem of finding the most profitable use of a firm's assets; my objective is to consider the choices and contingencies facing a decision maker operating under causal ambiguity. This paper presents a series of hypotheses that describe these choices and contingencies. In a sample of computer firms, a subset of these hypotheses are tested empirically in the context of experimental diversification as a specific case of calculative experimentation. The empirical results are generally supportive of the idea that diversification may occur as firms search to assign resources to uses. The paper concludes with a general discussion of the relationship between calculative experimentation versus purely random trial-and-error behavior and planned approaches to strategy making. The process of decision making may itself transform over time as causal understanding increases.</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamics provides two metaphors for organizational dynamics, bifurcation, and mathematical chaos. These metaphors make possible distinct observations about turbulent organizational processes that have previously been described as "chaotic." Careful distinction between the metaphors affords additional insight into organizational processes and can aid theory development. The metaphors are integrated into organizational process research through application to two current process theory taxonomies. New research directions in managing turbulence and constructing process models are suggested.</p>
            <p>We offer a revised institutional view of how new technology for information systems (IS) comes to be applied and diffused among organizations. Previous research argues that early adoption of a technological innovation is based on local, rational organizational choice, while later adoption is institutionalized and taken for granted. We suggest that institutional processes are engaged from the beginning. Specifically, a diverse interorganizational community creates and employs an organizing vision of an IS innovation that is central to its early, as well as later, diffusion. This vision serves key functions in interpretation, legitimation, and the organization and mobilization of economic roles and exchanges. The development and influence of an organizing vision is determined by a variety of institutional forces. Among these forces, the community's discourse serves as the developmental engine. Other factors-business commerce, the IS practitioners' world view, the motivating business problematic, the core technology, and material processes of adoption and diffusion-provide the discourse with its content, structure, motivation, and direction. Primary development of the organizing vision takes place during the innovation's earliest diffusion. The hesitant early majority among the prospective adopters relies on this development in its efforts to make sense of the innovation. Where the organizing vision remains underdeveloped after early adoption, later diffusion and institutionalization of the innovation is likely to be retarded.</p>
            <p>The impact of interorganizational systems (IOSs) on the structure of market networks is analyzed from a management perspective. A research framework is applied to various organizational settings, yielding a range of mixed mode forms in which elements of both market and hierarchy are evident. These forms are more complex than the simple network or hybrid structures postulated in the management and information systems literature. The framework represents a departure from electronic markets theory, questioning its basic predictions that as companies trade electronically there will be proportionately more markets than hierarchies. Instead, IOSs make possible relationships that combine market and hierarchy elements simultaneously. Although economic forces are driving the changes in network structure, economic variables are tempered by individual firm strategies reflecting investment, network structure and IOS choices. The implications for theory are that traditional analyses of network structures and competition in business markets do not describe or explain adequately the structure and dynamics of competition in an electronic trading environment. The implications for managers are that they should consider the effects of mixed mode network structures on their processes for forming and managing business relationships supported by IOSs. The contribution of the paper is to provide a more accurate model of competition in business markets by demonstrating that multiple forms of mixed mode network structures exist. The mixed mode proposition is illustrated with case data from a range of mixed mode network structures.</p>
            <p>During the heady revolutionary days of the 1960s, Slater and Bennis (1964) declared the inevitability of democracy at the workplace. Twenty-five years later, in a retrospection of that article, the authors claimed that they were right (Slater and Bennis 1990). Unfortunately, the data do not support their claim (Lawler et al. 1992). Nonetheless, workplace democracy is inevitable. This article argues in favor of the inevitability of participatory management, one form of workplace democracy, on the basis of its coherence to the social philosophical assumptions about human nature that underlie the forms of political arrangements (democracy) and economic arrangements (mixed economy) in the United States. These communitarian philosophical assumptions have been thoroughly argued in the political science and economic literature to be ethically superior to other sets of social philosophical assumptions that underlie authoritarianism and libertarianism. Currently, organization theory is approximately 200 years behind this literature. Persons who experience significant benefits as a result of the central position of "liberty" in the social philosophical assumptions of democracy and capitalism tend to design organizational systems that significantly restrict the liberty of their employees. The current push for more democratic features is coming from organization theorists doing work on corporate culture, total quality management, gainsharing, and other systems of management that encourage decentralization, and from business ethics scholars doing work on the societal accountability of organizations. The very slow rate of evolution to workplace democracy is primarily attributed to the central role of the power elite. Whereas the American political and economic revolutionaries came from within the power elite of their times that is not yet the case for workplace democracy advocates.</p>
            <p>The model developed draws on resource-based, information-processing, and organizational learning theories to show how JV control processes affect the dynamics of interpartner learning. According to the model, firms forming learning-related JVs match with partners in line with their differences in capability and other requirements; the result is referred to as the asymmetry-need configuration. A satisfactory postnegotiation match implies a balance in perceived bargaining power, enabling both partners to institute controls appropriate for the specific types of learning undertaken. The model stresses that appropriate controls are essential for learning to take place, yet dissimilar learning needs or learning capabilities of the two partners may nonetheless result in unequal learning rates. Such unequal learning sets into motion a continual reconfiguration of the original relationship between the two partners, including modification of the initial asymmetry-need configuration and perception of bargaining power. The model emphasizes that JVs with learning objectives are inherently and inevitably dynamic because of these internal processes. However, control mechanisms themselves are an important means for diagnosing these processes and realigning the relationship. The formulation of such a process model helps to integrate many aspects of the JV relationship, including initial configuration, partner bargaining power, JV controls, and interpartner learning. In addition, the model captures the evolution of the partner relationship over the life of the JV. The focus on JV control processes in this research complements the insights gained from previous work that has looked at JV learning mainly in relation to the characteristics of the partners.</p>
            <p>The dynamics of innovative search are investigated. A formal learning model is explicated to understand (1) how attention is allocated and (2) how attention and ideas are related during an active search. A particular chaotic regime of the model is shown to have dynamics similar to an actual search process. This motivates an agenda for research along three primary directions: refinements to the model, extensions that link the model to actions and decisions, and surroundings required to embed such a model in a larger context. The findings here suggest that chaos can occur in specific organizational processes over particular periods of time. Whether such chaos is beneficial to organizations is unclear.</p>
            <p>Although diffusion processes take place in a variety of social systems, they have rarely been studied within the context of an organization. Yet when the intraorganizational part of the diffusion of an innovation is gradual or differs among organizations, the overall diffusion of that innovation is affected. The authors explore the applicability of the traditional diffusion perspective in an intraorganizational context. They compare the explanatory power of factors emphasized by the traditional diffusion perspective with that of factors deemphasized or neglected by that perspective. The setting is the diffusion of electronic switching technology within the operating companies of the Bell System before its divestiture. The results suggest that the traditional perspective may not apply exactly within organizations because factors other than those traditionally emphasized seem to play an important role in the diffusion of innovations within organizations.</p>
            <p>Since its definition in the early 1980s, organizational demography has become an influential research area. Scholars map the relationship between demographic variables and organizational outcomes, examining such questions as whether increasing work group diversity leads to greater turnover and whether decreasing tenure similarity within a top management team leads to more numerous strategic reorientations. Asking such questions requires only a demographic predictor and an outcome, but answering them often requires additional theoretical constructs. For example, the relationship between work group diversity and turnover might be explained by communication and conflict. As work group diversity increases, communication within the group may become more difficult, resulting in greater conflict and thus increasing turnover. Despite the important, sometimes critical, role of such additional theoretical concepts, researchers often leave them loosely specified and unmeasured, creating a "black box" filled with vague, untested theories. This article presents a critical analysis of this approach. The results show that simple demographic explanations may generate multiple, mutually exclusive, often implicit theories involving numerous additional concepts. An evaluation of these more complex theories against previous research shows that they receive only weak support. Hence, the black box approach to organizational demography presents serious theoretical problems. Examples are provided to illuminate these problems. Four directions are suggested for research in organizational demography: deepening current variance explanations, creating dynamic models, exploring factors that produce demographic distributions, and moving beyond the variance model.</p>
            <p>Computer networks are an increasingly important technology for improving the efficiency of information processing and providing shared access to information resources. Because computer networks are increasingly being used to support the flow of information between and within organizations, their use both influences and has consequences for interorganizational relationships. An important and widespread application of interorganizational computer networks is Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), which refers to the computer-based exchange of standardized business-related information between buyer and supplier firms. The following theoretical framework addresses the role that power and trust play in EDI adoption and use. Firms with greater power can influence their trading partners to adopt EDI. But power can be exercised in different ways. Because computer networks provide a way for certain information to be more accessible to outside parties, their use makes organizational boundaries more permeable. When firms use coercive power to force trading partners to adopt EDI, less powerful partners may be left more vulnerable. And, over time this perceived vulnerability becomes a constraint in interorganizational relationships that prevents improvements in coordination through expanded use of EDI. On the other hand, when the event of EDI adoption is viewed as an opportunity to build and reinforce trust between firms, the relationship is able to support organizational changes (e.g., restructuring operational processes or new modes of distribution) related to EDI use which contribute to improving interorganizational coordination. The role of power and trust in EDI adoption has important implications for interorganizational theory. Their role may be especially helpful in understanding how technology, and, in particular, electronic media support strategic alliances that firms create to advance mutual goals.</p>
            <p>Drawing on categorization theory, semiotics, and labeling theory, we argue that categories and labels are widely utilized by individuals in organizational settings to help structure and simplify the social environment, primarily for reasons of understanding, consensus, and control. Based largely on such situational criteria as role and rank, people are sorted into various categories and are perceived and treated as exemplars or prototypes of the category. The labels attached to these categories coalesce when individuals triangulate their perceptions of category members with the perceptions that credible peers and powerholders have of category members. Labels distill a complex and perhaps contradictory array of data into concise and coherent packages, and thus provide a potent means of interpreting, representing, and conveying organizational experience and cuing action. However, labels are inherently arbitrary, labels cause individual category members to lose their individuality and assume the affective tone of the category, and labels tend to become reified as objective and normative accounts of social reality. The ubiquity and potency of labeling processes are illustrated with applications to individual-level (service encounters), group-level (intergroup conflict), and organization-level (identity, image, and reputation) phenomena. We speculate that both the process of labeling and the content of labels are similar across levels.</p>
            <p>Total Quality Management (TQM) and Socio-technical Systems Theory (STS) are two widely recognized and used work design strategies. While both approaches advocate some degree of technical proficiency and employee involvement, little research exists that has investigated potential synergies to be gained from combining central elements of the two. This paper directly addresses how these two approaches can be combined to simultaneously achieve organizational stability and flexibility. Contradictory as well as complementary features of TQM and STS are explored. A theoretical model addressing the potential for synergistic integration of TQM and STS is developed. Research propositions derived from this model are also provided to guide future research. Research based on these propositions can be instrumental in guiding ongoing organizational investments in TQM and STS. Ultimately, an integrated approach may be established that promises to simultaneously foster efficiency, stability, innovation, flexibility, psychological ownership, quality of worklife, continuous and discontinuous learning, and high organizational performance and customer satisfaction.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the nature of adaptive learning around new technology in organizations. To understand this issue, we examine the process of problem solving involving new production equipment during early factory use. We find that adaptation is a situated process, in that different organizational settings (1) contain different kinds of clues about the underlying issues, (2) offer different resources for generating and analyzing information, and (3) evoke different assumptions on the part of problem solvers. Consequently, actors frequently must move in an alternating fashion between different organizational settings before they can identify the causal underpinnings of a problem and develop a suitable solution. These findings suggest that traditional, decontextualized theories of adaptive learning and of collaboration could be improved by taking into account that learning occurs through people interacting in context-or, more specifically, in multiple contexts. Learning is often enhanced not just by bringing people together, but by moving them around to confront different sorts of clues, gather different kinds of data, use different kinds of tools, and experience different pressures relevant to a given problem. We discuss both managerial and theoretical implications of these findings.</p>
            <p>An organization's decision whether or not to train its workers affects the overall economy, even if the firm does not factor the economy into its decision. If all firms within an industry fail to train their workers, the whole economy suffers. Hence, training workers is a type of public good, a category that encompasses a broad range of social dilemmas. Employees face a similar dilemma in their choice of how much to contribute to the overall productivity of the organization. If employees receive a share of the profits regardless of their contribution, some may decide to free ride on the efforts of their fellow workers. If all employees decide to do so, the company will fail. The two dilemmas on the employee and organizational levels are closely interrelated. On one side, the benefits of training accrue only to the extent that employees contribute to the organization. Thus, a firm should take into account how it expects a training program to affect employee effort as well as employee turnover. On the other side, trained workers produce at higher rates, which in turn may affect how much they contribute and how often they migrate to other firms in comparison with untrained workers. The authors study the dynamics of training and turnover in firms facing both organizational- and employee-level dilemmas. First they establish a simple model that captures those conflicts and incorporates imperfect information and both worker and organizational expectations. Organizations can be both created and dissolved, and employees can move between firms, start new ones, or leave the industry for good. Next the authors summarize the different ways the dilemmas can unfold over time, collated from a number of computer experiments. For example, under one set of conditions, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. Alternatively, the organizational-level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In that case the overall productivity stays low. The authors find a positive correlation between high productivity, low turnover, and enterprise size, a relation that has also been observed in the empirical literature on training, stability, and turnover in organizations.</p>
            <p>This essay asserts that, although qualitative methods now enjoy wide legitimacy among organizational researchers, there are still times when it is best to conceal or downplay the role that qualitative data played in developing an author's ideas. I identify four circumstances where treating qualitative research as a closet rather than an open activity may help authors write papers that flow better, are more convincing, and are more readily accepted for publication. These circumstances are when weak qualitative data lead to good insights, when describing the qualitative research reduces the quality of the writing, when an outlet does not publish "empirical" papers, and when writing for an audience that remains biased against qualitative research. I illustrate these points primarily with my own closet qualitative research, but also draw on Cialdini's writings on the qualitative inspiration for his experimental research and discussions with colleagues about how they have used closet qualitative research.</p>
            <p>The formation of a network is determined by the opposition of two forces. The first is the reproduction of network structure as a general social resource for network members. The second is the alteration of network structure by entrepreneurs for their own benefit. The idea of reproduction is a conventional one in organizational sociology but has taken on increased importance due to the work of Bourdieu and Coleman. In contrast, Burt stresses the entrepreneurship of individual agents in exploiting structural holes that lie between constrained positions. Though complementary, the theories of social capital and structural holes have fundamentally different implications for network formation. This paper investigates these theories by examining empirically the formation of the interorganizational network among biotechnology firms. We propose that network structure determines the frequency with which a new biotechnology firm (or startup) establishes new relationships. Network structure indicates both where social capital is distributed in the industry and where opportunities for entrepreneurial action are located. The reproduction of network structure depends on how startups value social capital compared to these opportunities. The critical test is, consequently, whether new relationships reproduce or alter the inherited network structure. We find strong support for the power of social capital in reproducing the network over time.</p>
            <p>Studies of competition typically have two underlying assumptions: that competition occurs within the boundaries of industries or markets and that all firms in a market or industry are affected equally by competitive pressures. The concept of multipoint competition challenges both assumptions. Multipoint theory addresses how different levels of contact between firms across multiple markets affect competition in individual markets. Its main argument is that high levels of contact between firms across markets will induce mutual forbearance, causing multipoint competitors to refrain from aggressively attacking each other. The restraint stems from the fact that high levels of intermarket contact enable a firm to respond to an aggressive action by a multipoint rival in markets other than the one in which the action takes place. That possibility raises the potential costs of aggressive moves and serves as a credible deterrent, especially if a firm can respond in several markets. In addition, multipoint competition helps firms to interpret their rivals' intentions and signal their own, reducing the likelihood of costly misunderstandings. The authors elaborate on those ideas to examine how a hospital's degree of intermarket contact with its competitors in a particular service market affects the likelihood that it will exit that market. They find that hospitals are less likely to exit markets in which they meet large numbers of their multipoint rivals. As a result of mutual forbearance, competitive rivalry is reduced across the markets that multipoint rivals share, lessening the types of pressures that typically prompt market exit. With lower levels of competitive rivalry, markets shared by multipoint rivals are relatively more hospitable environments in which to operate and are less likely to be exited. Rather than competing intensely, multipoint rivals appear to adopt a "live and let live" approach toward each other. The fact that multipoint contact across markets may lessen competitive pressures within individual markets has implications for the contact between firms in several settings. Multimarket contact can occur across different product or service markets and also across different geographic markets, thus affording an intriguing perspective for the investigation of the rivalry between emerging transnational firms. True transnationals, by successfully integrating global operations while still addressing local market concerns, have been seen by some as having the capabilities necessary for successful performance in international competition. Perhaps transnational firms, because they have an integrated decision-making structure, can coordinate their actions to reduce competitive rivalry with each other across the markets they share. If so, markets dominated by transnationals may become more stable than the current state of international competition would predict.</p>
            <p>Despite the extensive literature on top management team structure (demographics), disagreement persists as to whether specific aspects of team structure have, on the whole, positive or negative results for the firm. The author addresses conflicts in the literature by using several typical structural measures in different contexts. Shorter-tenured, heterogenous teams are found to provide the skills needed to address environmental complexities and will be more productive in turbulent environments because they deliver problem solving skills and new perspectives on strategic formulation and implementation processes. Longer-tenured, homogeneous teams are found to be more productive in stable environments because they will promote basic team maintenance functions (socialization, cohesion, etc.). Firms that are the most successful financially are ones that match their team structures to the environmental context over time. The results reported are unique because time, different contexts, and financial performance were combined to assess the interaction of top management teams with their environments. Surprisingly, the type of turbulence encountered in the firm's context may determine whether a specific element of team structure will be beneficial or detrimental to financial performance. Relatively high levels of constant environmental change require different team structures than unusual, disruptive change. Differences are discussed.</p>
            <p>An important practical problem for many managers is finding alternative processes for performing a desired task, for example, one that is more efficient, cheaper, or that is automated or enhanced by the use of information technology. Improving processes also poses theoretical challenges. Coordination theory provides an approach to the study of processes. In this view, the design of a process depends on the coordination mechanisms chosen to manage dependencies among tasks and resources involved in the process. In this paper, I use coordination theory to analyze the software change process of a large mini-computer manufacturer. Mechanisms analyzed include those for task assignment, resource sharing, and managing dependencies between modules of source code. For each, I suggest alternative mechanisms and thus alternative designs for the process. The organization assigned problem reports to engineers based on the module that appeared to be in error, since engineers only worked on particular modules. Alternative task assignment mechanisms include assignment to engineers based on workload or market-like bids. Modules of source code were not shared, but rather "owned" by one engineer, thus reducing the need for coordination. An alternative resource sharing mechanism would be needed to manage source code if multiple engineers could work on the same modules. Finally, engineers managed dependencies between modules informally, relying on their personal knowledge of which other engineers used their code; alternatives include formally defining the interfaces between modules and tracking their users. Software bug fixing provides a microcosm of coordination problems and solutions. Similar coordination problems arise in most processes and are managed by a similar range of mechanisms. For example, diagnosing bug reports and assigning them to engineers may have interesting parallels to diagnosing patients and assigning them to specialists. While the case presented does not formally test coordination theory, it does illustrate the potential of coordination theory for exploring the space of organizational processes. Future work includes developing more rigorous techniques for such analyses, applying the techniques to a broader range of processes, identifying additional coordination problems and mechanisms and developing tools for collecting and comparing processes and automatically suggesting potential alternatives.</p>
            <p>The authors identify the key organizational and environmental characteristics that influence the effectiveness and efficiency of publicly funded service organizations. In a study of 40 community mental health centers (CMHCs), they used fulfillment of community needs as a measure of effectiveness and utilization of various services as a measure of efficiency. The results indicate that client educational status, state facility utilization, minority population, personnel expense, management type, and board composition affect need fulfillment. The study also illuminates the relationship between efficiency and effectiveness of publicly funded service organizations. The findings suggest that the allocation of resources to these organizations from local, state, and federal governments tends to be based on the extent of unmet needs for services. That is, the less the publicly funded service organization meets community needs, the more government funds are allocated to meet the needs. If the unmet needs that stimulate higher levels of funding actually reflect inefficiency, the inverse relationship between effectiveness and efficiency suggests that the government's resource allocation may not be based on performance, but may in fact be rewarding inefficiency. The findings suggest that legitimacy does not enhance efficiency and that legitimacy and efficiency may be entirely independent, which is consistent with institutional theory. The study results will be of practical use to community leaders, taxpayers, consumer advocates, regulatory agencies, and managers of community mental health organizations.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a co-evolutionary theory of strategic alliances. The paper proposes a framework which views strategic alliances in the context of the adaptation choices of a firm. Strategic alliances, in this view, are embedded in a firm's strategic portfolio, and co-evolve with the firm's strategy, the institutional, organizational and competitive environment, and with management intent for the alliance. Specifically, we argue that alliance intent may be described, at any time, as having either exploitation or exploration objectives. We further discuss how the morphology of an alliance-absorptive capacity, control, and identification-may be isomorphic with its intent, and, in the aggregate, drive the evolution of the population of alliances.</p>
            <p>Interfirm networks in general and strategic networks in particular are considered as an organizational form with distinct structural properties. Due to a lack of adequate theory, the working of network processes as well as the resulting network effectiveness is not very well understood. Structuration theory, developed by Anthony Giddens as a social theory, offers the potential not only to analyze network processes without neglecting structures but also to understand why many rather than few designs seem to be effective. As conceived here, this potential results, above all, from two interrelated theorems of structuration theory: the duality of structure and the recursiveness of social praxis. It will be concluded that these theorems offer valuable insights into organizing networks, especially into how structures of signification, domination, and legitimation shape network processes and how they are reproduced under the auspices of network effectiveness.</p>
            <p>Alliances are volatile key components of many corporations' competitive strategies. They offer fast and flexible means of achieving market access, scale economies, and competence development. However, strategic alliances can encounter difficulties that often lead to disappointing performance. The authors suggest that the way partners manage the collective learning process plays a central role in the success and failure of strategic alliances. Present understanding of interorganizational learning primarily focuses on how the individual organization can be a "good partner" or try to win the internal "race to learn" among the partners. The interorganizational learning dilemma is that (1) being a good partner invites exploitation by partners attempting to maximize their individual appropriation of the joint learning, and (2) such opportunistic learning strategies undercut the collective knowledge development in the strategic alliance. The authors develop a framework for understanding the dilemma through consideration of trade-offs between how collective learning is developed in alliances and how the joint learning outcomes are divided among the partners. They create a typology of five different learning strategies based on how receptive as well as how transparent an organization is in relation to its partners. The strategies are: collaboration (highly receptive and highly transparent); competition (highly receptive and nontransparent); compromise (moderately receptive and transparent); accommodation (nonreceptive and highly transparent); and avoidance (neither receptive nor transparent). Interorganizational learning outcomes are proposed to be the interactive results of the respective partners' type of adopted learning strategy. By synthesizing strategic alliance, organizational learning, collective action, and game theories, the framework contributes to understanding the variety in alliance development, performance, and longevity. Interorganizational learning is likely to be hindered by lack of either motivation or ability to absorb and communicate knowledge between the partner organizations. The dynamics of power, opportunism, suspicion, and asymmetric learning strategies can constitute processual barriers to collective knowledge development. In contrast, prior related interaction between the partners, high learning stakes, trust, and long-term orientation are likely to empower the collective learning process. Comparison of previous case studies and surveys of interorganizational learning provides partial empirical support for the proposed framework. The comparison also indicates several omissions in previous research, such as failure to consider either how receptive or how transparent the partners are, the interaction between their learning strategies, and their dynamic processes over time. Because these omissions are due partly to the methodological limitations of traditional case studies and cross-sectional surveys, the authors suggest a bridging case survey design for a more comprehensive test of their interactive, dynamic, and situational framework.</p>
            <p>This paper reports on a longitudinal case study of the interaction between two partners to a failed international joint venture. We develop a model of the collaboration process in partnership and alliances based on earlier work by Ring and Van de Ven (1994) and by Doz (1996). We employ a series of events that occurred in the course of the relationship as the unit of analysis in order to trace the interactions between the partners, and to explicate the impact that external shocks have on their perceptions of efficiency and equity. The impact of these events, as well as the responses they elicit, on the quality of the relationship (and vice versa) are also considered. We find that the partners' assessments cause them to either engage in renegotiation of the terms of the contract, or to modify their behavior unilaterally, in an attempt to restore balance to the relationship. The process feeds back until a new mutual understanding of equity is restored, or else the relationship deteriorates gradually until a point when the venture is dissolved. We conclude that positive feedback loops are critical in the evolutionary process, that relationship quality is both an outcome and a mediating variable, and that procedural issues are critical from the start in fostering a climate for positive reinforcement and the building of mutual trust and confidence in the relationship.</p>
            <p>This paper offers a theoretical explanation for why interfirm collaborations form yet fail, and further suggests how firms might manage them for a more positive outcome. Based on a perspective of value, we explain how a more inclusive and integrative perspective, one which combines elements from transaction costs and resource-based theory, provides more robust insight into collaboration formation, management, and instability. In doing so, we differentiate rent-yielding firm-specific assets at the core of the resource-based view from the transaction-specific assets at the core of transaction cost theory. The paper makes a crucial distinction between the potential value attainable through collaborations and its actual realization. The crux of our argument is that firms enter into collaborative relationships because these are expected to yield superior value relative to alternate organizational forms in certain situations, offering potentially synergistic combinations of complementary resources and capabilities, yet such relationships are frequently prone to failure because the partner firms tend not to recognize ex ante the nature and extent of transaction-specific investment that is required in the collaborative relationship to attain these synergies. In our argument, critically, the relationship between organizations is seen not simply as a governance structure of a hybrid nature but, more importantly, as a productive resource for value creation and realization. In this light, transaction-specific investment in what we term relational specificity becomes imperative. In the search for value, we explain why the transaction costs incurred in the exchange of resources are not independent of the nature of resources to be transacted and, similarly, why the returns realized from these resources are not independent of the relationship- and transaction-specific expenditures incurred in effectively combining them and maintaining the combination. The interdependence between the two, mediated by the quality of the relationship, has direct implications for the earning of rents through collaborations. These relationship-specific expenditures can be of an internally generated nature, endogenous to the alliance form itself, and need not exceed alternative forms, while the associated benefits have the capacity to potentially exceed the alternatives. This translates into potentially superior value. The paper contributes in three key related ways: (a) the explicit recognition of the relationship as a value-bearing asset embedded in a larger and endogenous institutional context, namely a system of resource relationships-both intraorganizational and inter-organizational-among partner firms and the collaboration, (b) the recognition of the evolving relationship between production and exchange which, at the level of the collaboration, is directly dependent on the nature, evolution, and dynamics of the relationship among the parties to the transaction, and (c) the provision of a nontrust explanation for why firms might knowingly forego opportunities to take advantage of their partners. Drawing from this, the paper occasions (a) a shift in focus from the form to the process of governance, which has direct implications for value creation and realization and (b) a shift in the primary identity of transaction-specific and relationship-specific expenditures from cost to investment in future value.</p>

            <p>Our paper develops a dynamic theory of alliances by examining certain outcome and process discrepancies that may emerge as the partners interact, highlighting issues that are especially relevant in knowledge intensive alliances, such as joint R&amp;D or product development. Firms enter into these types of alliances to create economic value and to acquire knowledge to enhance their competencies. The degree to which the partners can realize their objectives is dependent on their absorptive capacities and the collaborative strategies adopted by the partners. Outcome and process discrepancies may emerge as collaboration unfolds. Outcome discrepancies concern the ability of the partners to achieve their economic and learning objectives. Process discrepancies relate to the partners' satisfaction with the pattern of interaction, and affect their feelings of psychological attachment to the relationship. How the partners assess and react to discrepancies shapes the developmental path of an alliance. The alliance flourishes in certain states but may collapse in others as the collaboration is subjected to environmental changes or shifts in the grand strategies of the partners. Guidelines for assessing and managing outcome and process discrepancies are suggested.</p>
            <p>This paper links the alliance strategy of emergent firms to the structural relations in the network of new firm organizers. Data gathered in Russia from 1991 to 1993 on nine post-Soviet commodity exchange markets demonstrate how the difference in internal social structure between spin-off and startup exchanges shapes the strategy of their inter-firm networks and initial performance. The way in which managers come together structures their diversity and openness to the outside environment. In turn, the social structure internal to the firm affects the range and scope of their ties to other organizations. I show how the high range of overlap among the ties between spin-off founders has a more concentrated connection to the outside environment than the exchanges created by more loosely-linked startup founders. The relational costs of the more concentrated ties increases the cost of search, however, it lowers the cost of malfeasance. Thus, the model suggested proposes that the relative advantage of investing in relational capital is a double-edged sword which poses constraints along with its particular advantages. Finally, the model also brings to question the relative merits of concentrated alliances supposedly advantageous to new firms in particular by suggesting that conditions of transition and institutional instability may under-cut the relative advantage of familiarity and specialization found in Western settings.</p>
            <p>A number of well-known studies report that between one-third and two-thirds of international joint ventures eventually break up. While many generalizations, explanations, and prescriptions have been based on these statistics, their meaning is unclear. First, all foreign affiliates are subject to normal business risk, and to the risk that they will be divested by parents for strategic or financial reasons. Are these risks higher for joint ventures than for wholly-owned subsidiaries? Second, joint ventures may be shorter lived not because of their joint venture status, but because affiliates which are joint ventured have other characteristics that make them more likely to exit. To know whether joint ventures are shorter lived, one must control for the other factors that affect the longevity of affiliates, whether wholly-owned or joint ventured. Third, many joint ventures contracts contain clauses that allow partners to sell their stakes to one another at specific intervals. Because they make exit easier, joint ventures should have shorter lives, but these shorter lives should only be due to selloffs, not to liquidations. It is therefore important to see whether the supposedly higher termination rate of joint ventures stakes is due to a higher rate of selloffs or to a higher rate of liquidations. In this paper we (1) compare the longevity of stakes in joint ventures versus those in wholly-owned subsidiaries (2) while controlling for other factors that affect the longevity of such stakes and (3) while distinguishing between two types of exit, those through sale and those through liquidation. While past authors have addressed these three issues in piecemeal fashion, we believe we are the first to address them simultaneously. We analyze the factors that affect the longevity of 355 Japanese stakes in U.S. manufacturing affiliates. Controlling for all the factors that affect exit rates, we find that Japanese parents are more likely to terminate their stakes in U.S. joint ventures than in wholly-owned subsidiaries. This higher termination rate of joint venture stakes is explained by a higher probability of selling them, but not of liquidating them. Most of the other factors that have been found significant in explaining gross divestment of foreign affiliates do in fact only affect exits through sales, but not exits through liquidations. Hence it is true that joint ventures have shorter lives, but dangerous to interpret this finding as necessarily meaning that they are more likely to "fail".</p>
            <p>Constellations-alliances among multiple firms-are used to perform complex, customized work in professional service. We examine two tensions inherent in multi-party collaborative work: managing hybrid systems, which are composed of individual and group tasks and outcomes, and aligning partners' logics of action. These two tensions provide firms the strategic choice with emphasizing individual or collective advantage. When constellation members pursue an individualist strategy, they employ an entrepreneurial logic. Constellations are a vehicle for honing their firm-distinctive expertise and enhancing their own opportunities. Given these firms' need for exposure to new learning and new markets from different partners and clients, the stability of the constellation is not of primary importance. This strategy promotes membership shifts in constellations and requires governance mechanisms for coordinating interactions among relative strangers. When constellation members pursue a collectivist strategy, they focus on their mutual benefits and employ a relational logic. Given these firms' need for intensifying relations with partners and clients, constellation members restrict interactions to certain select partners and clients and intensify their interactions. This strategy promotes stability in constellation membership and allows governance mechanisms specific to partners to develop. Due to positive feedback, these strategies develop certain capabilities and create specific relational patterns, which reinforce prior choices.</p>
            <p>This article presents a public goods-based theory that describes the process of producing multifirm, alliance-based, interorganizational communication and information public goods. These goods offer participants in alliances collective benefits that are (a) nonexcludable, in that they are available to all alliance partners whether or not they have contributed, and (b) jointly supplied, in that partners' uses of the good are noncompeting. Two generic types of goods produced are connectivity, the ability of partners to directly communicate with each other through the information and communication system, and communality, the availability of a commonly accessible pool of information to alliance partners. Four types of alliances that can produce these goods are identified: (a) precompetitive, (b) competitive, (c) joint value creation, and (d) value chain. The article examines a variety of factors that influence the production of alliance-based connective and communal goods. Twenty-three integrated propositions are presented. The article concludes with an example of the application of the theoretical model to research on connectivity and communality provided through an alliance-based interorganizational communication and information system linking more than 50 alliance partners.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the problem of risk mitigation in virtual organizations (VOs). We begin by discussing risk propensity in virtual organizations, and draw on a variety of research to suggest processes important in obtaining high levels of reliable performance in VOs. From this research we identify four processes we think are important: organizational structuring and design, communication, culture, and trust. Based on existing research done in conventional and high reliability organizations (HROs), we suggest how these processes may enhance reliability in VOs. We discuss how thoughtful management of these attributes can mitigate risk, and conclude with a theoretical and research agenda for future work.</p>
            <p>One view holds that organizations are virtual to the extent that they outsource key components of their production processes, and that electronic networks make it easier to do this. The goal of the present paper is to examine explicitly the effects that use of electronic networks for transactions with suppliers has on firms' degree of virtualization. In so doing, we also highlight factors that influence the use of networks for coordination with suppliers, and the impact such use has on coordination success. Contrary to much recent speculation, the use of electronic networks for transactions was not associated with increased outsourcing, but rather with greater dependence on internal production. Moreover, the use of interpersonal relationships for coordination, which many think of as an alternative to electronic network use, was positively associated with greater network use. Surprisingly, use of electronic networks was negatively associated with such outcomes as order quality and efficiency, and satisfaction with suppliers, while more reliance on personal linkages was associated with better outcomes and mitigated the negative consequences of using electronic networks.</p>
            <p>Virtual organizations that use e-mail to communicate and coordinate their work toward a common goal are becoming ubiquitous. However, little is known about how these organizations work. Much prior research suggests that virtual organizations, for the most part because they use information technology to communicate, will be decentralized and nonhierarchical. This paper examines the behavior of one such organization. The analysis is based on a case study of the communication structure and content of communications among members of a virtual organization during a four-month period. We empirically measure the structure of a virtual organization and find evidence of hierarchy. The findings imply that the communication structure of a virtual organization may exhibit different properties on different dimensions of structure. We also examine the relationship among task routineness, organizational structure, and performance. Results indicate that the fit between structure and task routineness affects the perception of performance, but may not affect the actual performance of the organization. Thus, this virtual organization is similar to traditional organizations in some ways and dissimilar in other ways. It was similar to traditional organizations in so far as task-structure fit predicted perceived performance. However, it was dissimilar to traditional organizations in so far as fit did not predict objective performance. To the extent that the virtual organizations may be similar to traditional organizations, existing theories can be expanded to study the structure and perceived performance of virtual organizations. New theories may need to be developed to explain objective performance in virtual organizations.</p>
            <p>The current study is a first step in investigating how virtual organizations can manage remote employees effectively. The research used self-efficacy theory to build a model that predicts relationships between antecedents to employees' remote work self-efficacy assessments and their behavioral and attitudinal consequences. The model was tested using responses from 376 remote managed employees in 18 diverse organizations. Overall, the results indicated that remote employees' self-efficacy assessments play a critical role in influencing their remote work effectiveness, perceived productivity, job satisfaction, and ability to cope. Furthermore, strong relationships were observed between employees' remote work self-efficacy judgments and several antecedents, including remote work experience and training, best practices modeling by management, computer anxiety, and IT capabilities. Because many of these antecedents can be controlled managerially, these findings suggest important ways in which a remote employee's work performance can be enhanced, through the intermediary effect of improved remote work self-efficacy. The current study also provides a basis for future research in the remote work area through its development and testing of a remote management framework.</p>
            <p>Recent advances in information technologies provide employees the freedom to work from any place and at any time. Such temporal and spatial dispersion, however, weakens the ties that bind organizations and their members. We suggest that organizational identification may be the critical glue linking virtual workers and their organizations. We explore the role that information technologies play in the creation and maintenance of a common identity among decoupled organization members.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the challenges of creating and maintaining trust in a global virtual team whose members transcend time, space, and culture. The challenges are highlighted by integrating recent literature on work teams, computer-mediated communication groups, cross-cultural communication, and interpersonal and organizational trust. To explore these challenges empirically, we report on a series of descriptive case studies on global virtual teams whose members were separated by location and culture, were challenged by a common collaborative project, and for whom the only economically and practically viable communication medium was asynchronous and synchronous computer-mediated communication. The results suggest that global virtual teams may experience a form of "swift" trust, but such trust appears to be very fragile and temporal. The study raises a number of issues to be explored and debated by future research. Pragmatically, the study describes communication behaviors that might facilitate trust in global virtual teams.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the link between a firm's resources and its efficient organization form with a focus on entrepreneurial resources. Entrepreneurial resources are defined as the propensity of an individual to behave creatively, act with foresight, use intuition, and be alert to new opportunities. This paper assumes that these entrepreneurial resources can be distributed in two ways throughout the firm: they can be held by one or a few individuals-"individual entrepreneurial resources"-or they can be dispersed among a team of individuals-"team entrepreneurial resources." Agency theory is used to consider how various organizational characteristics-such as the assignment of decision responsibilities, incentives and risk bearing, the number of hierarchical levels, horizontal linking structures, mutual monitoring and bonding devices, and information systems-will differ in the individual and team entrepreneurial forms. Generally, the individual entrepreneurial form resembles the "classic entrepreneurial firm" (Fama and Jensen 1983) in which various decision making roles and risk bearing are performed by a single entrepreneur. The team entrepreneurial form is similar to what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1993) call "beyond the m-form." Responsibility for steps in the decision process is dispersed in the team form, and monitoring the decision process will occur at the organization's apex. The CEO will not make operational or strategic decisions; instead, he manages the internal market for managers and develops an organization's cultural context and information systems. Below the CEO level, team entrepreneurs are responsible for ratifying innovative decisions, and below this team entrepreneurs are responsible for initiating innovative decisions. After presenting these two entrepreneurial forms, this paper relates them to extant research on corporate entrepreneurship and organizational forms.</p>
            <p>This paper argues that a key component in a firm's strategic response to unfamiliar environmental events is the interpretations managers develop about the event itself and about key dimensions of their strategy. Using historical data from the pharmaceutical industry, the revealed interpretations of top management from six firms over a ten-year period are analyzed and are compared to the timing and content of the changes in strategy each firm undertook following a significant change in regulation. The results reveal two distinct patterns of interpretation development that appear to be linked to whether or not the target of interpretation is familiar. Further, interpretations appear to be linked both temporally and in terms of content to the strategic change undertaken by each firm. Both sets of results suggest that the interpretations of managers are linked to organizational actions.</p>
            <p>Top managers of British and French firms, which were recently acquired by either British or French firms, were surveyed as to their perceptions of the administrative approach-reflected in integrating mechanisms-used by the acquiring firms to establish headquarters-subsidiary control. Four types of integrative mechanisms were examined: structural, systems, social, and managerial. A multiple analysis of covariance model, coupled with a two-nation (British and French), two-merger type (domestic, cross-national) sampling design, found evidence that the administrative approaches used by managers during merger integration from two nations partially reflect their different heritages, and that these differences are consistent with national differences and the theoretical perspectives of institutional development and cross-cultural studies. Our findings, while exploratory, provide insight into the administrative difficulties of managing across borders and help us understand why many cross-national firms continue to use ethnocentric approaches in spite of the incentives for adopting a transnational approach. Moreover, our findings add one more voice to a growing chorus calling for a theory of the firm, as embedded, institutionally, culturally, and historically.</p>
            <p>When people use electronic mail, they can communicate even when they are not physically or temporally proximate. Thus, it is not surprising that most studies report that the use of electronic mail increases organizational communication. In the study presented here, overall organizational communication declined as use of electronic mail increased. As we probed the nature of this decline, we discovered that much of the lost communication was greetings. This raises questions about the role that greetings, and other forms of casual conversation, play in an organization. To organize our insights about this topic we formulate a two-by-two communication matrix based on presence versus absence and availability versus unavailability. Prior research focuses on the ways being present and available and being absent but available through electronic mail affect the performance of specific communication tasks. Using our typology, we direct attention to the role of casual conversation in presence availability and to the parts that presence unavailability and absence unavailability can play in organizational communication.</p>
            <p>Using a large-scale data set on product development organizations of Japanese manufacturing firms, this paper explores the effects of organizational capabilities on product development performance. We present a conceptual framework assuming that organizational capabilities consist of multilayered knowledge. Based on the idea, we classify organizational capabilities into "local," "architectural," and "process" capabilities along two dimensions: modularity and designability. The empirical analysis demonstrates differential effects of different types of organizational capabilities on different types of product development performance, and compares the differential effects between two types of industries that differ in terms of their product characteristics: system based and material based. The central message from our analysis is that the process capabilities emerging from dynamic interaction of knowledge play a crucial role as core capabilities for product development of Japanese firms in the system-based industries in which Japanese firms are relatively competitive. In the material industries, however, local capabilities have major effects on performance while effects of process capabilities are limited, which underlies the relative weakness of Japanese firms in developing material-based products. Our results raise some intriguing implications on the competitive advantages and challenges of Japanese firms' product development.</p>
            <p>The author introduces the concept of strategic learning to explain long-run dynamics of strategic behaviors and organizations. Because a firm's long-run adaptation is realized through a series of strategic behaviors and organizational innovations, organizational capability to design effective strategic behaviors and organizational structure is critical for a firm's growth and survival. A series of strategic behaviors is shaped through the stable generation mechanism. Strategic learning is organizational learning that improves the strategic capability of the organization and changes the basic assumptions underlying the stable generation mechanism that structures the strategic behavior design process. Organizations have various levels of knowledge and learn at all levels. The levels of organizational learning interact, making higher order learning such as strategic learning problematic. Distinguishing characteristics of strategic learning are that it is learning without questioning and without unlearning in advance. It starts from a current set of basic assumptions and ends with a new set of basic assumptions. Referring to related literature and a case study, the author describes the process of strategic learning as an intraorganizational ecological process, integrating various levels of learning in organizations and including processes of both strategic knowledge creation and strategic knowledge distillation. He also discusses theoretical and practical implications derived from the strategic learning model.</p>
            <p>The heralding of improved economic indicators has generated worldwide interest in New Zealand's economic experiment despite the growing concern about the social repercussions of such rapid economic liberalisation. This paper argues that the compliance of New Zealanders to this economic experiment was achieved through the simultaneous development of a discourse of economic liberalism and a discourse of "the management of quality" and the subsequent cooption of the latter by the former. As an experiment for potential global emulation, this paper cautions those who pin their hopes for social justice on a common commitment to increasing productivity in the context of neoconservative economic policy preferences.</p>
            <p>The dilemmas experienced by managers in cultural industries are also to be found in a growing number of other industries where knowledge and creativity are key to sustaining competitive advantage. Firms that compete in cultural industries must deal with a combination of ambiguity and dynamism, both of which are intrinsic to goods that serve an aesthetic or expressive rather than a utilitarian purpose. Managers involved with the creation, production, marketing, and distribution of cultural goods must navigate tensions that arise from opposing imperatives that result from these industry characteristics. In this paper we outline five polarities that are shaping organizational practices in cultural industries. First, managers must reconcile expression of artistic values with the economics of mass entertainment. Second, they must seek novelty that differentiates their products without making them fundamentally different in nature from others in the same category. Third, they must analyse and address existing demand while at the same time using their imagination to extend and transform the market. Fourth, they must balance the advantages of vertically integrating diverse activities under one roof against the need to maintain creative vitality through flexible specialization. And finally, they must build creative systems to support and market cultural products but not allow the system to suppress individual inspiration, which is ultimately at the root of creating value in cultural industries.</p>
            <p>In this paper we outline a key mechanism through which organizational fields are constituted. We suggest that in competitive fields, the market serves as a magnet around which groups of actors consolidate, and that cognition of markets occurs through the creation, distribution, and interpretation of a web of information about the "market." To illustrate our theory, we present a case study of the Billboard music chart from the commercial music industry to show that changes in either scope, methodology, or political tone with which market information is presented can provide a major jolt to the participants' understanding of their field.</p>
            <p>In this qualitative field study, I explore how the construction of a cultural institution's identity is related to the construction of strategic capabilities and resources. I investigated the 1996 musicians' strike at the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (ASO), which revealed embedded and latent identity conflicts. The multifaceted and specialized identity of the ASO was reinforced by different professional groups in the organization: the ideologies of musicians and administrators emphasized institutional resource allocations consistent with the legitimating values of their professions, i.e., artistic excellence versus economic utility. These identity claims, made under organizational crisis, accounted for variations in the construction of core competencies. I propose a model that explicates how the construction of core capabilities lies at the intersection of identification and interpretive processes in organizations. Implications are discussed for defining firm capabilities in cultural institutions and for managing organizational forms characterized by competing claims over institutional identity, resources, and core capabilities.</p>
            <p>Since the mid 1980s, organization theorists have highlighted the emergence of the networked model of organization as a response to global competition and pressures for increased market flexibility. Cultural industries have not been immune from this development. In this paper, we examine the shift from hierarchy to network in the U.K. television industry. We argue that an important result of this disaggregation is the emergence of latent organization, groupings of individuals and teams of individuals that persist through time and are periodically drawn together for recurrent projects by network brokers who either buy in programmes for publisher-broadcasters or who draw together those artists and technicians who actually produce them. In conclusion, we note how latent organizations may become increasingly important for effective cultural industry production, and in particular how they may provide stable points of reference and recurring work projects for those many individuals now working outside of large, vertically integrated producer-broadcasters.</p>
            <p>Past research has established that large bureaucratic firms are less innovative than other firms. This reduced innovativeness is likely to be exacerbated when large firms engage in market control. In cultural industries, the effects can be especially pernicious, resulting in the failure to provide audiences with artistic quality or product diversity. We investigate the population dynamics of one cultural industry: the early American feature film industry. Specifically, we examine the hypothesis that concentration among large generalist firms will be associated with higher rates of foundings of specialist producers and specialist distributors. We also investigate the question of whether these specialists are more innovative. Specifically, we examine the hypothesis that specialists were more active than were generalists in the creation of new film genres in the early years of the American film industry. We find that increased concentration among generalists had a positive effect on foundings of specialist producers and specialist distributors, and that the specialists were more active in the creation of new film genres. Implications of these findings for future research, both on cultural industries and on the population dynamics of the founding of specialist firms, are discussed.</p>
            <p>Valuation of cultural products tends to be problematic. In this paper, we provide insight into how valuation of cultural products takes place by describing the changing role and significance of different types of selection systems. Three basic types of selection systems are distinguished: market selection, peer selection, and expert selection. We show that the rise of a group of painters known as the Impressionists was facilitated by a change in the selection system of the visual arts industry from one dominated by peers into one dominated by experts. In the new selection system, innovativeness has become the most highly prized product characteristic, while a range of experts have begun to play an essential role, certifying the innovativeness of either individual artists or groups of artists.</p>
            <p>This study explores the organizational values that characterize firms in the nonprofit professional theatre industry, and examines the links between firms' organizational values and their relationships with external constituents. Using grounded research methods, we uncover five value dimensions that are relevant to arts organizations: prosocial, artistic, financial, market, and achievement. Using a sample of 97 nonprofit theatres, we extend our qualitative inquiry with an empirical investigation of how firms enact their organizational values to build and maintain relationships with external constituents. Results from a two-wave survey design indicate consistent patterns of association between organizational values and (1) perceptions of values congruence with external constituents, (2) human resource allocation and programming decisions that firms make to support relationships with external constituents, and (3) the level of financial resources that firms obtain from their relationships with different external constituents. Interestingly, results from both investigations hint at underlying tensions between competing values in cultural firms, such as pressures to be both artistic- and market-oriented.</p>
            <p>Many researchers believe that bounded rationality prevents CEOs in large, complex, multidivisional ("M-form") corporations from personally formulating division-level strategies. Instead, CEOs are seen as guiding a "bottom-up" process whereby division managers propose strategies for review and approval by the corporate office. Contrary to this view, we argue that CEOs in global media firms frequently drive strategy in a "top-down" manner, especially when their firms seek to expand by integrating the activities of two or more existing divisions. We refer to such firms as "Entrepreneurial M-forms," and maintain that their reliance on an activist CEO offers benefits: (1) in turbulent environments, when the use of slow, bottom-up planning processes risks forfeiting first-mover advantages; and (2) when expansion entails major capital commitments, and division managers may be reluctant to accept the career risks associated with sponsorship of "bet-the-company" projects.</p>
            <p>In my early "Processing Fads and Fashions: An Organization-Set Analysis of Cultural Industry Systems" (1972), the middle "throughput" phase, or most organizational aspect of cultural industries, was emphasized. In this depoliticized exploration of what Adorno (1991) had earlier characterized as the industrialization of high culture, and Powdermaker (1950) as Hollywood's "dream factory," I emphasized the key roles of gate-keeper and distributor organizations as critical in connecting the artist/creators to audience/consumers of mass, or "popular" culture (as it had more acceptingly come to be called). Altogether, this network of organizations-from creators (artists, musicians, actors, writers) and brokers (agents), through the cultural product's producers (publishers, studios), distributors (wholesalers, theaters), and media outlets-collectively constitute cultural industries. This article on industries producing "cultural products"-defined as "`nonmaterial' goods directed at a public of consumers, for whom they generally serve an esthetic or expressive, rather than a clearly utilitarian function" (Hirsch 1972 p. 641)-appeared at the same time that organizational sociology's focus on what became known as the "production of culture" took off, and continued to flourish into the 1990s (Peterson 1994, Crane 1992). How has the study of cultural industries changed over the last generation? A simple answer is that the subject-the key role of distribution and the importance of organizational middlemen in the making and sale of popular culture-remains analytically the same. From actors, musicians, and writers; through studios, labels and publishers, to videocassettes, movie theaters, record stores, and booksellers (in stores or via the Internet)-cultural products flow. How this sequence is organized and traversed remains a fascinating forest of power plays and techniques, employed by role-occupants in the same positions as have existed since the advent of mass media. While this substantive field has changed little analytically, what we also see is a wondrous expansion in the disciplinary approaches being taken to examine the multitude of topics available for examination under the broad rubric and framing of the term, "cultural industries." Because I was a graduate student at the time (my roommate dared me to submit the "Processing..." paper to the American Journal of Sociology), it is a great pleasure to find the concept has retained its value for other researchers since that time. In this article, I will (1) reexamine and discuss the original framing of the term cultural industries; (2) briefly review some of the more recent complementary perspectives which expand the possible arenas for studying this topic; and (3) append a short note on how the more recent inclusion of nonprofit cultural products (e.g., symphonies, museums) in this framework poses interesting analytical questions and opportunities.</p>
            <p>This natural experiment investigates the introduction and use of a pair of competing video telephone systems in a company over a period of 18 months. Both quantitative, time-series analyses and in-depth interviews demonstrate that employees adopted and used the video systems for both utility and normative reasons. Consistent with utility explanations, people in the most communication-intensive jobs were the most likely to use video telephony. Consistent with social influence explanations, people used a particular system more when more people in general were using it and when more people in their work group were using it. There were two conceptually distinct, but empirically entangled, types of social influence. First, use by other people changed the objective benefits and costs associated with using the systems, and thus their utility. Second, use by others changed the normative environment surrounding the new technology. Both utility and normative influences were stronger in one's primary work group. Implementers, users, and researchers should consider both utility and normative factors influencing both the success and failure of new organizational communication systems.</p>
            <p>The management and processing of organizational knowledge are increasingly being viewed as critical to organizational success. By exploring how firms access and exploit alliance-based knowledge, the authors provide evidence to support the argument that the firm is a dynamic system of processes involving different types of knowledge. Using data from a longitudinal study of North American-based joint ventures (JVs) between North American and Japanese firms, they address three related research questions: (1) what processes do JV partners use to gain access to alliance knowledge; (2) what types of knowledge are associated with the different processes and how should that knowledge be classified; and (3) what is the relationship between organizational levels, knowledge types, and the transfer of knowledge? Although many generalizations have been drawn about the merits of knowledge-based resources and the creation of knowledge, few efforts have been made to establish systematically how firms acquire and manage new knowledge. Moreover, prior alliance research has not addressed in detail the nature of alliance knowledge and how knowledge is managed in the alliance context. The authors examine the processes used by alliance partners to transfer knowledge from an alliance context to a partner context. They identify four key processes-technology sharing, alliance-parent interaction, personnel transfers, and strategic integration-that share a conceptual underpinning and represent a knowledge connection between parent and alliance. Each of the four processes is shown to provide an avenue for managers to gain exposure to knowledge and ideas outside their traditional organizational boundaries and to create a connection for individual managers to communicate their alliance experiences to others. Although all of the knowledge management processes are potentially effective, the different processes involve different types of knowledge and different organizational levels. The primary types of knowledge associated with each process are identified and then linked with the organizational level affected by the transfer process. From those linkages, several propositions about organizational knowledge transfer and management are developed. The results suggest that although a variety of knowledge management strategies can be viable, some strategies lead to more effective knowledge transfer than others.</p>
            <p>Two studies were conducted to investigate the indigenous concept of guanxi and its applications in the Chinese context. Guanxi refers to the existence of direct particularistic ties between an individual and others. We relate the concept to the idea of relational demography, which refers to similarities or differences between an individual and others on such factors as age, gender, race, religion, education, and occupation. The two studies focused on the importance of guanxi and relational demography in Chinese employment settings. In study 1, their importance was examined in a sample of 560 vertical dyads (i.e., between supervisor and subordinate) in Taiwan. In study 2, the effects were analyzed in a sample of 205 horizontal dyads, specifically between business executives and their important business connections (e.g., key customers, suppliers, bankers, government officials) in mainland China. Results support the importance of both guanxi and relational demography for subordinate trust in the supervisor, but only guanxi is found to be (extremely) important for business executives' trust in their connections. Implications for future cross-cultural research on the effect of common ties are discussed.</p>
            <p>The effects of strategic order of entry on firms' performance have long been an issue in many areas of study. Past research efforts, however, have been concentrated mostly on first mover or early entrant advantages. To contribute to developing a theory of latecomer strategies, the authors investigate how latecomers compete successfully or even leapfrog early movers. They review previous studies on early mover advantages and disadvantages, and group the sources of such advantages or disadvantages into three areas: the firm, its market, and its competitors. The theoretical focus is how a firm converts the opportunities stemming from entry order into performance. The authors seek to confirm and extend relevant theories by examining how late entrants have caught up with incumbent industry leaders in the global semiconductor industry. On the basis of in-depth case analysis of three Japanese and three Korean semiconductor companies, they identify and categorize successful latecomer strategies into two types: strategies for overcoming latecomer disadvantages and strategies for utilizing latecomer advantages. Focusing, thin margin or loss bearing, and volume building form the essence of strategies for overcoming disadvantages, whereas odd timing, time compression, humanembodied technology transfer, benchmarking, technological leapfrogging, and resource leveraging form the essence of strategies for utilizing advantages. Because many companies in Asia have had to face the reality of being latecomers, the Asian perspectives are particularly useful for studying and explicating latecomer strategies.</p>
            <p>Effective organizational learning requires high absorptive capacity, which has two major elements: prior knowledge base and intensity of effort. Hyundai Motor Company, the most dynamic automobile producer in developing countries, pursued a strategy of independence in developing absorptive capacity. In its process of advancing from one phase to the next through the preparation for and acquisition, assimilation, and improvement of foreign technologies, Hyundai acquired migratory knowledge to expand its prior knowledge base and proactively constructed crises as a strategic means of intensifying its learning effort. Unlike externally evoked crises, proactively constructed internal crises present a clear performance gap, shift learning orientation from imitation to innovation, and increase the intensity of effort in organizational learning. Such crisis construction is an evocative and galvanizing device in the personal repertoires of proactive top managers. A similar process of opportunistic learning is also evident in other industries in Korea.</p>
            <p>Research on cross-cultural psychology, sociology, and anthropology suggests that the influence of face on social interactions is both pervasive and powerful in Asia. Face, however, has not gained general acceptance as an important theoretical concept in the literature on Asian organizational behavior and management. In this paper, we propose face as a key variable that can explain much of the complexity of social interactions in Asian organizations. We attempted to elaborate on the concept and dynamics of face in Asia in such a way as to capture its pervasive, significant but often subtle influences on organizational behavior. We also examined conditions, functions, and consequences of face dynamics to generate testable propositions for future research. We argue that scholars have to go beyond the individualistic assumptions about human behavior implicit in theories of organizational behavior in the West to better understand the richness of organizational behavior in Asia. In Asia, organizational behavior is better predicted by an individual's external attributes such as face than internal attributes such as desires, emotions, and cognition.</p>
            <p>Accumulating empirical evidence on American managers shows that social-capital effects on performance are a function of the information and control benefits of bridging structural holes-the disconnections between nonredundant contacts in a network. Is that network form of social capital unique to Americans? France seemed to us a productive site for comparative research because the image from past research is that French managers are more regulated than Americans; more regulated by bureaucratic authority and more regulated by peer pressure, with both amplified by the greater reliance in France on internal labor markets. People comfortable with knowing their place in a chain of bureaucratic control could be uncomfortable with the negotiated control exercised by network entrepreneurs, so the positive association between structural holes and performance in the United States could be negligible or even reversed for French managers. We use network and performance data on two study populations of senior managers, one in France and one in the United States, to describe social capital similarities and differences between the populations. The network form of social capital is similar in the two populations: More successful French managers, like Americans, tend to have networks rich in structural holes. The French and American managers make similar distinctions between kinds of relationships. Relations that bridge structural holes are similarly detached from routine work activities for the French and the Americans. The interesting difference is that social capital develops differently in the two populations. The French managers operate with a less porous social boundary around their firm and associate negative emotions with bridge relations. Reinforcing Aix-en-Provence observations on the significance of adult education for Franco-German differences in organization, we find that exposure to peers in other firms via executive education is for our French managers the only factor positively associated with the social capital of bridge relationships.</p>
            <p>Many employees in the world are evaluated and rewarded at work based on who they are ("particularism") rather than based on impersonal judgments of their performance ("universalism"). Yet the field of organizational behavior has been virtually silent on how employees react to workplaces dominated by particularism. In an effort to understand the role of particularistic organizational practices, several ideas from comparative institutions theories are applied to questions of organizational behavior, and the model is tested in samples of large manufacturing and service organizations in the United States and Hungary. It was found that employees in a modernist political system (United States) did echo social scientists' claims by reporting that their employers' personnel practices were comparatively more universalistic than those in organizations operating in a neotraditional polity (Hungary). This perception of differences in personnel practices mediated the relationship between political system and employees' trust in one another, their perceptions of coworker shirking, and their organizational commitment.</p>
            <p>Theorizing about communication media attitudes and behaviors has drawn upon multiple theories (e.g., media richness, social influence). But these theories have often been pitted against each other rather than considered as complementary in more comprehensive studies. Furthermore, previous research has tended to focus more on newer communication media such as electronic mail rather than more traditional media. Finally, communication media research has studied attitudes toward media, use of media, and only occasionally media choice. Yet, all three dependent variables are important. This comprehensive survey hypothesized and tested multiple influences (based on multiple theories) in a study of media attitudes and behaviors. The media included electronic mail, fax, letters, and face-to-face meetings. The outcomes included media choice (an individual's decision to use a medium in a particular communication incident), media use (an individual's general pattern of use over time), and media attitudes (an individual's general subjective evaluation of media). Results suggested that a number of factors differentiated among media choices, including medium symbolism, message equivocality, distance between message partners, perceived media richness, number of message recipients, and perceived message recipients' attitudes. General attitudes toward the different media were influenced most consistently by perceived medium richness. New media attitudes were also influenced by person/technology interaction factors. General medium use was influenced by different factors for the different media. The results generally supported a comprehensive theoretical approach to understanding media attitudes and behaviors. All of the theories have some merit in explaining media attitudes and behaviors. But different factors, derived from different theories, were more important in accounting for each of the dependent variables-media choices, attitudes, and use. We hope that this investigation will help research in this area move toward the development of more integrative theoretical models.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the tension between two opposite views on how networks create social capital. Network closure (Coleman 1988) stresses the role of cohesive ties in fostering a normative environment that facilitates cooperation. Structural hole theory (Burt 1992) sees cohesive ties as a source of rigidity that hinders the coordination of complex organizational tasks. The two theories lead to opposite predictions on how the structure of an actor's network may affect his ability to adapt that network to a significant change in task environment. Using data from a newly created special unit within the Italian subsidiary of a multinational computer manufacturer, we show that managers with cohesive communication networks were less likely to adapt these networks to the change in coordination requirements prompted by their new assignments, which in turn jeopardized their role as facilitators of horizontal cooperation within a newly created business unit structure. We conclude with a discussion of the trade-off between the safety of cooperation within cohesive networks and the flexibility provided by networks rich in structural holes.</p>
            <p>This article describes an holistic model of intervention geared to achieving transformational change by interweaving culture and structure through the warp and weft of leadership processes. That is, it brings together organization design and organization development by advocating a culturally sensitive approach to organization structuring. Our emphasis is on process throughout and our thesis is based on empirical evidence. We undertook a lengthy action research project (which we prefer to call "action ethnography") at a large hospital trust in England. In the process of elaborating this field study, we move from an organization which was seen to be "gridlocked" and to have "lost its steering capacity", through one which was bringing development and design together by way of pilot projects and transitional structures, to one where collective dialogue and debate finally led to some collective and sensible sensemaking. Exploring this relationship between culture and structure enables us to put people back into design and with them, their meanings, aspirations and assumptions. It also means that we are careful to avoid detailing specific design choices or offering organizational archetypes: this article is primarily about the process issues that surround redesign rather than organization design per se, as indeed any redesign is ultimately highly specific and context-driven. Instead, however, we articulate a four-phase change model, focusing on the delicate processes by which to reframe the culture-structure relationship, enabling an organization to move towards fundamental change.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the cognitive aspects underlying industries in hypercompetitive environments. Hypercompetition represents a state of competition with rapidly escalating levels of competition and reduced periods of competitive advantage for firms. In hypercompetitive industries member firms act boldly and aggressively to create a state of competitive disequilibrium. In this paper we explore the particular conditions that managers encounter in making sense of hypercompetitive industries and argue that the nature of these conditions is such that conventional sensemaking frameworks will not work. We then describe the "adaptive sensemaking" practices established in the literature for dealing with temporary turbulence and suggest that in hypercompetition those processes continue indefinitely. We argue that these processes can become institutionalized as standard operating procedures within firms, and as shared recipes within industries, which in turn perpetuates hyperturbulent conditions.</p>
            <p>This is a response to the special issue of Organization Science on Jazz Improvisation and Organizing (Vol. 9, No. 5, 1998). It is a call to unpack the jazz metaphor by extending the notion of jazz, and thereby the value of the metaphor, beyond the limited definition described in the issue. In that issue, jazz was described as a process of improvising within a highly constrained structure and set of rules. Other genres of jazz, however, have gone beyond those constraints. Jazz improvisation has occurred within forms, with forms, and beyond forms. Perhaps organizational improvisation may as well.</p>
            <p>We analyzed employee resistance to an organizational change project in which employees were empowered to participate in the design of a new organizational structure. What emerged from our analysis was the importance of cognitive barriers to empowerment. Employees' resistance appeared to be motivated less by intentional self-interest than by the constraints of well-established, ingrained schemas. Resistance was also fueled by skepticism among the employees about management's commitment to the new decision-making schema, especially because employees judged managerial actions to be inconsistent with their new espoused framework. A grounded model of schema change is developed for changes in organizational decision-making schemas during empowerment efforts. Theoretical implications and suggestions for improving organizational change efforts are proposed.</p>
            <p>Behind every successful performance, such as was the jazz symposium at the 1995 Academy of Management Conference, are people who have worked long and hard to try to ensure that the event will come to fruition; who have solved tricky problems and improvised in a number of ways, so that the performers can do their craft with a maximum of opportunity to excel. In the case of this symposium, organizing involved having very specialized microphones in place and in working order. It required getting all the right permits (some unanticipated) approved and it meant having an effective grasp of and control over the logistics of a complex process well beyond the prior experience base of most of the organizers involved. It meant doing these things at a ridiculously low price and yet operating at a cost that was higher than anticipated. New money had to be found, rules and laws had to be bent or reframed or reinterpreted. When the magic of the session unfolded, when people were learning, having fun and being moved by what they experienced on stage, it was due, in no small part, to the individuals behind the scenes who themselves had performed, learned and improvised and who thus had helped created conditions that enabled the event to take place. Such individuals often are unsung heroes. They have stories to tell that are interesting and instructive. What follows are the recollections of one such hero, Steve Havlovic, Chair of the Local Arrangements Committee for the 1995 Academy of Management Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In conversation with Peter Frost, he talks about the roles that he and others who worked with him played in preparing the ground for the jazz symposium and he describes some of what happened along the way. The story provides a perspective on the way improvisation and organizing may be intertwined in both the figure and the ground of a novel event.</p>
            <p>Applying unfettered but disciplined imagination to last night's Academy of Management 1995 session on the jazz metaphor, I asked: How would I design an organization as if it were a medium for improvisational jazz? I know that the design metaphor grates on some sensibilities. Bear with me. I am a tinkerer and bricoleur at heart. I write as thought emerged subject to minor editing.</p>
            <p>It has often been proposed, or assumed, that improvisation is a useful metaphor to provide insight into managing and organizing. However, improvisation is more than a metaphor. It is an orientation and a technique to enhance the strategic renewal of an organization. The bridge between theory and practice is made through exercises used to develop the capacity to improvise, borrowed from theatre improvisation. This paper describes a typical improvisation workshop in developing six key areas that link improvisation exercises to the practice of management: interpreting the environment; crafting strategy; cultivating leadership; fostering teamwork; developing individual skills; and assessing organizational culture.</p>
            <p>What if rent from a competitive advantage is appropriated so it cannot be observed in performance measures? The resource-based view was not formulated to examine who will get the rent. Yet, this essay argues that the factors leading to a resource-based advantage also predict who will appropriate rent. Knowledge-based assets are promising because firm-specificity, social complexity, and causal ambiguity make them hard to imitate. However, the roles of internal stakeholders may grant them a great deal of bargaining power especially relative to investors. This essay integrates the resource-based view with the bargaining power literature by defining the firm as a nexus of contracts. This new lens can help to explain when rent will be generated and, simultaneously, who will appropriate it. In doing so, it provides a more robust theory of firm performance than the resource-based view alone. It is also suggested that this lens might be useful for examining other theories of firm performance.</p>
            <p>By taking a learning approach to international cooperative ventures, this study introduces absorptive capacity as a principle governing the relationship between knowledge possession and knowledge search among prospective partners. Two alternative hypotheses are juxtaposed: The first is that firms will seek additional knowledge in the same area in which they already have a knowledge base; the second is that firms will seek knowledge in a complementary area. Data from 90 partner-seeking firms in China show that the possession of complementary knowledge is a prerequisite for knowledge search. Furthermore, in line with the learning perspective, the equity joint venture is the vehicle of choice for firms seeking transfer of tacit, embedded knowledge.</p>
            <p>Knowledge is frequently the focus of corporate acquisitions. It often cannot be acquired in efficient factor markets due to asymmetric information and because it may be bundled in teams or networks. However, variations in quality are harder to observe for knowledge-based assets than for tangible assets. This creates information dilemmas for buyers and, accordingly, a risk of overbidding, whenever a target is in a knowledge-intensive industry. This study found that most buyers took steps to mitigate the information dilemmas associated with knowledge-based assets. Specifically, buyers coped by (1) offering lower bid premia; (2) using contingent payment (e.g., stock or earnouts); and (3) increasing information both through lengthy negotiations and by avoiding tender offers. However, when the two firms drew on unrelated forms of expertise, buyers did not apply these strategies. It may be that a buyer's information needs are lower if little postacquisition integration is anticipated. An alternative explanation is that unrelated buyers may not be fully aware of the information dilemmas that they face. If so, they may be especially at risk of over-bidding. The contingency relationship identified here with respect to related expertise warrants further study. Both the resource-based and diversification literatures presume that relatedness is universally important. This study suggests that it may be particularly relevant when there are knowledge-based assets.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the economic processes through which information technology can facilitate coordination within and between firms. The paper presents and analyzes a case study of the B-2 "Stealth" bomber, an aircraft that was designed by four firms almost entirely by computer. The key information systems used in the project were (1) a common-access database to manage part designs and (2) an advanced system to perform structural analysis. These systems played a crucial role in enabling the four firms to coordinate their design and development activities precisely enough to meet the demanding engineering requirements imposed by the aircraft's unique mission. The paper analyses the case study using transaction cost, agency, and information processing theories. The analysis leads to several conclusions about the mechanisms through which the variables emphasized in these theories operated to improve coordination. First, the information systems aided coordination directly by making information processing less costly. Second, this enhanced information processing made the governance of the project more efficient. In particular, by establishing a "technical grammar" for communication, the systems helped to create social conventions around which firms could coordinate their activities, thus limiting the need for a hierarchical authority to promote coordination. This technical grammar also reduced governance costs by reducing asset-specificity, thereby reducing risks associated with contractual holdup. These interactions between communication and governance effects have not been elucidated in the IT/coordination literature. They are important in part because they help explain why the vertically disintegrated organization of the project proved viable. Finally, the systems facilitated decentralized decision-making by reducing agency (measurement) costs. This combination of effects may generalize to other settings in which information technology is used to promote coordination, especially in "virtual" or "disaggregated" corporations.</p>
            <p>This paper begins to answer the call to broaden current theories of individual decision-making by including in them the effects of human mood. Grounding our arguments in psychological literature on the effects of mood on information processing, motivation, and decision heuristics, we develop hypotheses about how mood can significantly affect individuals' use of structured decision protocols. In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a structured decision protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a structured decision protocol, (2) execute the steps of a structured decision protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the structured decision protocol as the primary basis for the decision. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for both organizational decision models and psychological models of mood and decision-making. In general, our findings help establish mood as an important variable in models of organizational decision-making and help shed light on often conflicting findings about the benefits of positive vs. negative mood for individual decision-making.</p>
            <p>The rise and fall of organizational effectiveness, an "umbrella construct" once at the forefront of organizational theory, is traced through four life-cycle stages: emerging excitement, the validity challenge, "tidying up with typologies," and construct collapse. Although the study of effectiveness has declined, research on its component elements continues to thrive. Using the effectiveness story as an exemplar, we develop a more general model of this process for all umbrella constructs, defined here as broad concepts used to encompass and account for a diverse set of phenomena. This life-cycle model-driven largely by a dialectic between researchers with a broad perspective ("umbrella advocates") and those with a narrower one ("validity police")-leaves open the possibility that some umbrella constructs may ultimately be made coherent or remain permanently controversial rather than collapse, as effectiveness has done. We propose that umbrella constructs will arise most frequently in academic fields without a theoretical consensus, will inevitably have their validity seriously challenged, will have a shorter life than their constituent elements, and will be more vulnerable to validity challenges when they lack support from practitioners. This model's implications for the future direction of such current umbrella constructs as organizational learning, culture, strategy, and performance are also explored and elaborated. Ironically, some evidence suggests that studies around the construct of organizational "performance" have arisen to replace the nearly identical, but fallen umbrella construct of organizational effectiveness.</p>
            <p>This paper outlines an alternative theory of organization-environment coevolution that generalizes a model of organization adaptation first proposed by March (1991), linking firm-level exploration and exploitation adaptations to changes in the population of organizations. The theory considers organizations, their populations, and their environments as the interdependent outcome of managerial actions, institutional influences, and extra-institutional changes (technological, sociopolitical, and other environmental phenomena). In particular, the theory incorporates potential differences and equifinal outcomes related to country-specific variation. The basic theses of this paper are that firm strategic and organization adaptations coevolve with changes in the environment (competitive dynamics, technological, and institutional) and organization population and forms, and that new organizational forms can mutate and emerge from the existing population of organizations. The theory has guided a multicountry research collaboration on strategic and organization adaptations and the mutation and emergence of new organizational forms from within the existing population of organizations.</p>
            <p>This paper advances the understanding of absorptive capacity for assimilating new knowledge as a mediating variable of organization adaptation. Many scholars suggest a firm's absorptive capacity plays a key role in the process of coevolution (Lewin et al., this issue). So far, most publications, in following Cohen and Levinthal (1990), have considered the level of prior related knowledge as the determinant of absorptive capacity. We suggest, however, that two specific organizational determinants of absorptive capacity should also be considered: organization forms and combinative capabilities. We will show how these organizational determinants influence the level of absorptive capacity, ceteris paribus the level of prior related knowledge. Subsequently, we will develop a framework in which absorptive capacity is related to both micro- and macro-coevolutionary effects. This framework offers an explanation of how knowledge environments coevolve with the emergence of organization forms and combinative capabilities that are suitable for absorbing knowledge. We will illustrate the framework by discussing two longitudinal case studies of traditional publishing firms moving into the turbulent knowledge environment of an emerging multimedia industrial complex.</p>
            <p>Many scholars have described organization form as a management tool in the alignment of organization and environment. As the environment of many companies becomes more chaotic, the exploration of organization forms characterized by flexibility and adaptability has been intensifying. When reviewing existing literature on new organization forms, several gaps become apparent. These gaps can be traced back to the artificial separation between the macrolevel and the firm level of analysis and the prevalence of a static notion of form. To contribute to a more encompassing theory of new organization forms, a coevolutionary perspective is suggested. In this perspective, contextual variation of macrolevel management logics is proposed as a key mediator in the coevolution of organization and environment. At the firm level, the contextual variation of management logics is reflected in shared managerial schemas underlying strategic design actions. The resulting coevolutionary model shows how contextual applications of management logics may be a source of variation in new organization forms. On the basis of a literature review, three management logics, representing ideal types, are described: classical management logic, modern management logic, and postindustrial management logic. These logics are related to three levers of design actions which reflect fundamentally different interventions in form. Linking management logics to design levers results in a set of propositions to be tested in future empirical research.</p>
            <p>This paper addresses three weaknesses in the literature on new organizational forms: the limited mapping of the extent of contemporary organizational change; confusion about how contemporary changes link together; and the lack of systematic testing of the performance consequences of this kind of change. Drawing on a large-scale survey of organizational innovation in European firms, the paper finds widespread but not revolutionary change in terms of organization structure, processes, and boundaries. Using the economics notion of complementarities, the paper develops contingency and configurational approaches to suggest that organizational innovations will tend to cluster in particular ways and that the performance benefits of these innovations depend on their clustering. Complementarities in performance are explored from both inductive and deductive perspectives. Consistent with the expectations of complementarity theory, high-performing firms appeared to be innovating more and differently than low-performing firms. Again consistent with complementarities, piecemeal changes-with the exception of IT-were found to deliver little performance benefit, while exploitation of the full set of innovations was associated with high performance. Though few European firms were found to exploit the complementarities of new organizational practices, those that did enjoyed high-performance premia.</p>
            <p>Much writing in the field of strategic management remains an exercise in comparative statics. Cross-sectional research designs are combined with the static metaphors of contingency thinking to analyse the fit between the positioning and resource base of the firm and its performance in differing environments. However, the inadequacies of this tradition are increasingly recognised even by scholars who have created it (Porter 1991). Strategy can no longer be conceived through the static language of states or positions and must now be understood as an innovation contest where the bureaucratic and inflexible will not survive. This paper takes up the challenge to explore the dynamics of industry and firm strategy development. The empirical focus of the paper is the U.K. insurance industry in a period of upheaval between 1990 and 1996. By means of an innovative cross-correlational time series analysis, we are able to show the ebb and flow of strategic change in the industry and the patterns of initiation and imitation as certain firms lead areas of strategy and others follow. These findings are interrogated and interpreted by drawing on and developing theoretical ideas from three literatures which historically have not talked to one another. These are the literatures on innovation, institutionalism, and contextualism. The empirical results show firms pursuing multiple strategies at one point in time and also altering the strategic agenda over time. A cross-correlational analysis of nine firms in the U.K. insurance industry reveals the existence of leaders and laggards in the development of a variety of strategic initiatives. Theoretically the paper examines the mixture of external conditions and internal context and processes which contribute to the development of early and later adopters of strategies in an industry over time.</p>
            <p>In many industries, the contemporary context of acute environmental dislocation shows the limits of traditional organizational recipes. In direct response to environmental challenges, companies are experimenting with new organizational solutions. While flexibility, or the capacity to redefine organizational form to follow changing purposes, is undeniably a common trend, these experiments otherwise differ greatly. Diversity is such, in fact, that it is difficult to clearly identify and define a unique organizational paradigm for the future. To explore the connection between environmental dislocation and organizational transformations, we adopt a historical and comparative perspective. Our empirical base of evidence is the luxury fashion industry in three countries. France, Italy, and the United States. For many years, this industry was defined by stable environmental conditions, and a craft model of organization remained dominant. We show that, over a more recent period, increasing environmental turbulence has brought about a redefinition of the rules of the game. A common response has been for organizations to move towards greater flexibility or modularity and to experiment with network forms. However, we also show that the paths or trajectories leading to organizational flexibility have varied significantly across countries, reflecting historical legacies and institutional constraints. We identify in fact three different network forms in that industry, which represent national ideal types-the "umbrella holding" company in France, the "flexible embedded network" in Italy, and the "virtual organization" in the United States. We argue that the process of change in the luxury fashion industry has been one of coevolution, where environmental transformation and organizational change have fed upon each other through time. Pioneer firms in the luxury fashion industry originally devised organizational solutions within the bounds set by nationally defined constraints and opportunities. Becoming institutionalized, these early solutions in turn shaped the environment for individual organizations and organizational populations, creating new sets of opportunities and constraints. In a path-dependent manner, different models of organization and national competitiveness thus emerged. In conclusion, we are brought to question the likelihood of full and stable convergence towards a unique organizational form or paradigm. There appears to be, in each national context, a process of construction of new organizational solutions that starts from local foundations. Embedded as they are in powerful historical and institutional legacies, organizational differences are there to stay, we believe, beyond the period of transition and acute environmental dislocation.</p>
            <p>This paper examines a single longitudinal case study of a professional service network in the public accounting industry, a network intentionally created and formally organized to pursue residual referral revenue for the member firms. Applying and extending a coevolutionary perspective (Koza and Lewin 1998), the paper explores the antecedents and stimuli for the formation of the network, the network's morphology, the motivation of the network members, and the ways in which the network coevolves with its environment and with the adaptation practices of its members. We find that the network was initially created with the strategic intent of producing incremental income in exchange for cross-border referrals. However, we also find that this strategy reveals asymmetric positive returns, which produce serendipitous opportunities for individual member firms to bypass the original intent of network by entering each other's market. We propose that such tensions may be endemic to alliance networks, and we explore their sources and consequences on a variety of characteristics, including network stability, member opportunism, and control. The paper concludes with a model of the coevolutionary process.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we set out to investigate whether strategic leadership matters at a moment in the life cycle of the firm when a change is made in the top leadership. By far, most of the conceptual and empirical literature on the consequences of CEO succession involves United States companies. Therefore, in this paper, we set out to investigate the impact of CEO succession on strategic and organizational changes in Japanese companies. The empirical study consisted of a matched control group design involving 81 Japanese companies experiencing a CEO succession event and 81 companies with continuity of their CEO leadership. The results of the study can be summarized as follows. Overall CEO succession was not associated with radical strategic and organization changes. Japanese companies did engage in evolutionary organization and strategic adaptations during the five year period of the study but independent of CEO succession. The governance structure moderates organization changes (independent of CEO succession) in particular when the firm was affiliated with a main bank and the firm was experiencing severe financial pressure.</p>
            <p>This article is concerned with the assessment of the substantiation of management decisions in practice. The necessity for this undertaking derives from the fact that to be successful, management must choose the right extent of analysis for preparing major decisions. Testing this hypothesis requires the ability to measure the thoroughness of a decision preparation and to relate different levels of thoroughness to the success of the decision outcomes. In this paper, the author first presents the conceptual framework of argumentation rationality which makes it possible to measure the thoroughness of a decision preparation-or in other words, the soundness of reasons given for the decision. For a concrete-trial usage, the concept is then combined with the methodology of account analysis introduced by Lewin (Lewin 1996, Lewin and Hunter 1996, Hunter 1999) for the research project on "New Organization Forms in the Information Age" (NOFIA). The arguments given explicitly in the accounts express rationales for management decisions and thus give hints on the intensity of the decision preparation. Using a simplified version of the measuring concept which assesses the argumentation rationality on three selected rationality determinants (pro/contra relation, depth of arguments, and breadth of arguments), two different types of rationality analyses are carried out to illustrate the fruitfulness of the approach. First, on the basis of 16 accounts concerning an important strategic decision of Daimler-Benz made in 1985 (becoming an integrated technology group), the arguments discussed during that time are identified and structured for assessing the substantiation of decision preparation. The developed structure of reasoning not only allows a formal evaluation, but in addition offers starting points for a substantial discussion of the change action. Secondly, 138 accounts from the German automotive industry of the years 1990-1997 are analyzed in order to identify first typical patterns of management argumentation. Based on the available empirical foundation, four types of reasoning are isolated, which differ characteristically with respect to the considered rationality determinants. The paper closes with a perspective on significant questions for further elaborating as well as employing the concept in future research.</p>
            <p>Complex organizations exhibit surprising, nonlinear behavior. Although organization scientists have studied complex organizations for many years, a developing set of conceptual and computational tools makes possible new approaches to modeling nonlinear interactions within and between organizations. Complex adaptive system models represent a genuinely new way of simplifying the complex. They are characterized by four key elements: agents with schemata, self-organizing networks sustained by importing energy, coevolution to the edge of chaos, and system evolution based on recombination. New types of models that incorporate these elements will push organization science forward by merging empirical observation with computational agent-based simulation. Applying complex adaptive systems models to strategic management leads to an emphasis on building systems that can rapidly evolve effective adaptive solutions. Strategic direction of complex organizations consists of establishing and modifying environments within which effective, improvised, self-organized solutions can evolve. Managers influence strategic behavior by altering the fitness landscape for local agents and reconfiguring the organizational architecture within which agents adapt.</p>
            <p>This paper treats organizations as adaptive systems that have to match the complexity of their environments. The nature of this complexity is analyzed by linking an institutional Information-Space (I-Space) framework to the work of complexity theorists. The I-Space framework identifies the codification, abstraction, and diffusion of information as cultural attributes. Codification involves the assignment of data to categories, thus giving them form. Abstraction involves a reduction in the number of categories to which data needs to be assigned for a phenomenon to be apprehended. Information is diffused through populations of data-processing agents, thus constituting the diffusion dimension. Complexity theorists have identified the stability and structure of algorithmic information complexity in a way that corresponds to levels of codification and abstraction. Their identification of system parts and the richness of cross-coupling draws attention to the fabric of information diffusion. We discuss two modes of adaptation to complex environments: complexity reduction and complexity absorption. Complexity reduction entails getting to understand the complexity and acting on it directly, including attempts at environmental enactment. Complexity absorption entails creating options and risk-hedging strategies, often through alliances. The analysis, and its practical utility, is illustrated with reference to China, the world's largest social system. Historical factors have shaped the nature of complexity in China, giving it very different characteristics than those typical of Western industrial countries. Its organizations and other social units have correspondingly handled this complexity through a strategy of absorption rather than the reduction strategy characteristic of Western societies. Western firms operating in China therefore face a choice between maintaining their norms of complexity reduction or adopting a strategy of complexity absorption that is more consistent with Chinese culture. The specifics of these policy alternatives are explored, together with their advantages and disadvantages. The paper concludes with the outlines of a possible agenda for future research, focusing on the investigation of complexity-handling modes and the contingencies which may bear upon the choice between them.</p>
            <p>We define the complex system underlying organizational culture by incorporating the social-psychological principles of balance and information (B-I) into models of influence (changes in attitudes as a function of interaction) and selection (changes in interaction). We identify information based influence as a potential anchor for actors' sentiments so that they are not overwhelmed by normative influence. In the model of selection, we identify the pursuit of information as an important counterbalance to the effect of homophily (interacting with others like oneself). Using the tools of dynamic systems we show how our models generate the full range of equilibria of complex systems. Through simulations we also explore how our system responds to exogenous effects.</p>
            <p>This paper examines how organization theory can benefit from advances made in the interdisciplinary field of complex systems theory (CST). Complex systems theory is not so much a single theory as a perspective for conceptualizing and modeling dynamic systems. The field of complexity is described in terms of the characteristics of systems that are typically the subject of its study, the type of analytical tools used by researchers in this field, and the recurring paradigms that characterize this research perspective. The concepts of self-organized criticality and self-organization and their relevance to organizational studies are examined. The potential usefulness of these concepts is illustrated in the context of organizational evolution and social network analysis. An alternative model of organizational evolution, based on biological evolution, is proposed and propositions are developed. Unlike traditional models for organization, this model does not rely on an algorithm of optimization of a fitness function. The problem of self-organization is approached from the viewpoint of random graph theory and is applied to the analysis of social networks. Finally, important issues in using concepts from the field of CST are discussed. It is suggested that the immediate benefits of CST may be as a framework that facilitates conceptual elaborations and encourages formal modeling; both activities may provide fresh and deep insights into organizational phenomena.</p>
            <p>Can firms and coevolutionary groups suffer from too much interdependent complexity? Is complexity theory an alternative explanation to competitive selection for the emergent order apparent in coevolutionary industry groups? The biologist Stewart Kauffman suggests a theory of complexity catastrophe offering universal principles explaining phenomena normally attributed to Darwinian natural selection theory. Kauffman's complexity theory seems to apply equally well to firms in coevolutionary pockets. Based on complexity theory, four kinds of complexity are identified. Kauffman's "NK[C] model" is positioned "at the edge of chaos" between complexity driven by "Newtonian" simple rules and rule-driven deterministic chaos. Kauffman's insight, which is the basis of the findings in this paper, is that complexity is both a consequence and a cause. Multicoevolutionary complexity in firms is defined by moving natural selection processes inside firms and down to a "parts" level of analysis, in this instance Porter's value chain level, to focus on microstate activities by agents. The assumptions of stochastically idiosyncratic microstates and coevolution in firms are analyzed. Competitive advantage, as a dependent variable, is defined in terms of Nash equilibrium fitness levels. This allows a translation of Kauffman's theory to firms, paying particular attention to (1) how value chain landscapes might be modeled, (2) assumptions underlying Kauffman's models making them amenable to firms, and (3) a delineation of seven of Kauffman's computational experiments. As part of the translation, possible parallels between the application of complexity catastrophe theory to coevolutionary pockets and studies by institutional theorists and social network analysts are discussed. The models derive from spin-glass microstate models resulting in Boolean games. Kauffman's Boolean statistical mechanics is introduced in developing the logic underlying the somewhat simplified NK[C] model. The model allows the use of computational experiments to better understand how the dependent variable-value chain fitness-is affected by changes in the number of internal interdependencies K, the number of coevolutionary links with opponents C, the size of the coevolutionary pocket S, and the number of simultaneous adaptive changes, among other things. Various computational experiments are presented that suggest strategic organizing approaches most likely to foster competitive advantage. High or low Nash equilibrium fitness levels are shown to result from internal and external coevolutionary densities as a function of links among value chain competencies within a firm and between a firm and an opponent. Complexity phenomena appear to suggest a number of expected (and thus validating) and surprising strategies with respect to complex organizational interdependencies. For example, moderate complexity fares best and external coevolutionary complexity sets an upper bound to advantages likely to be gained from internal complexity. Various complexity "lessons" are discussed. Models such as the NK[C] could offer insights into strategic organizing.</p>
            <p>What is the relative importance of structural versus contextual forces in the birth and death of scientific theories? We describe a formal dynamic model of the birth, evolution, and death of scientific paradigms based on Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions. The model represents scientific activity as a changing set of coupled institutions; a simulated ecology of interacting paradigms in which the creation of new theories is stochastic and endogenous. The model captures the sociological dynamics of paradigms as they compete against one another for members, solve puzzles, and recognize anomalies. We use sensitivity tests and regression to examine the role of intrinsic versus contextual factors in determining paradigm success. We find that situational factors attending the birth of a paradigm largely determine its probability of rising to dominance, while the intrinsic explanatory power of a paradigm is only weakly related to the likelihood of success. For those paradigms surviving the emergence phase, greater explanatory power is significantly related to longevity. However, the relationship between a paradigm's "strength" and the duration of normal science is also contingent on the competitive environment during the emergence phase. Analysis of the model shows the dynamics of competition and succession among paradigms to be conditioned by many positive feedback loops. These self-reinforcing processes amplify intrinsically unobservable microlevel perturbations in the environment-the local conditions of science, society, and self faced by the creators of a new theory-until they reach macroscopic significance. Such path dependent dynamics are the hallmark of self-organizing evolutionary systems. We consider the implications of these results for the rise and fall of new ideas in contexts outside the natural sciences such as management fads.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the management literature has increasingly emphasized the importance of self-organization and "local action" in contrast to prior traditions of engineering control and design. While processes of self-organization are quite powerful, they do not negate the possibility of design influences. They do, however, suggest that a new set of design tools or concepts may be useful. We address this issue by considering the problem of landscape design-the tuning of fitness landscapes on which actors adapt. We examine how alternative organizational designs influence actors' fitness landscapes and, in turn, the behavior that these alternative designs engender. Reducing interdependencies leads to robust designs that result in relatively stable and predictable behaviors. Designs that highlight interdependencies, such as cross-functional teams, lead to greater exploration of possible configurations of actions, though at the possible cost of coordination difficulties. Actors adapt not only on fixed landscapes, but also on surfaces that are deformed by others' actions. Such couupled landscapes have important implications for the emergence of cooperation in the face of social dilemmas. Finally, actors' perceptions of landscapes are influenced by the manner in which they are framed by devices such as strategy frameworks and managerial accounting systems.</p>
            <p>Studies of organizational processes can yield observations in the form of event time series that can be analyzed to determine whether they reflect periodic, chaotic, white noise, or pink noise dynamic patterns. These different patterns each imply different underlying generative mechanisms and hence, different process theories. In this paper we present a model that describes how these four dynamical patterns are different from one another. Specifically, a causal system can be characterized by its dimensionality, and by the nature of interaction between causal factors. Low dimensional causal systems yield periodic and chaotic dynamics, while high dimensional causal systems yield white and pink noise dynamics. Periodic and white noise dynamics stem from systems where causal factors act independently, or in a linear fashion, while chaotic and pink noise systems stem from systems where causal factors act interdependently, in a nonlinear fashion. Thus, given a diagnosis of an observed event time series, we can hypothesize a particular story, or causal process theory, that might explain in organization-specific terms why such dynamics came about. In doing so, we also propose that the observation of chaotic organizational dynamics may often signify the presence of control and/or cooperation, rather than a lack of it, as implied by the vernacular use of the term. We conclude by challenging organizational researchers to define new models that capture such observed behavior.</p>
            <p>Global virtual teams are internationally distributed groups of people with an organizational mandate to make or implement decisions with international components and implications. They are typically assigned tasks that are strategically important and highly complex. They rarely meet in person, conducting almost all of their interaction and decision making using communications technology. Although they play an increasingly important role in multinational organizations, little systematic is known about their dynamics or effectiveness. This study built a grounded theory of global virtual team processes and performance over time. We built a template based on Adaptive Structuration Theory (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) to guide our research, and we conducted a case study, observing three global virtual teams over a period of 21 months. Data were gathered using multiple methods, and qualitative methods were used to analyze them and generate a theory of global virtual team dynamics and effectiveness. First, we propose that effective global virtual team interaction comprises a series of communication incidents, each configured by aspects of the team's structural and process elements. Effective outcomes were associated with a fit among an interaction incident's form, decision process, and complexity. Second, effective global virtual teams sequence these incidents to generate a deep rhythm of regular face-to-face incidents interspersed with less intensive, shorter incidents using various media. These two insights are discussed with respect to other literature and are elaborated upon in several propositions. Implications for research and practice are also outlined.</p>
            <p>This study examined two alternative explanations for disparity in reported work-related experiences and outcomes between black and white managers: treatment discrimination because of race, and differences in human and social capital. Education and training, representing human capital, and racial similarity of network ties and proportion of strong ties, representing social capital, were used to predict whether human and social capital would mediate the relationship between race and the work-related experiences and outcomes under investigation. Results of a survey of black and white managers in a Fortune 500 financial services firm indicate that black managers reported a slower rate of promotion and less psychosocial support than white managers. Race had both a direct and an indirect effect on these outcomes. Participation in company training significantly predicted reported promotion rates, but race remained a significant predictor. Additional analysis revealed that race moderates the relationship between human capital and promotion rate and suggests a type of treatment discrimination against blacks. Contrary to predictions, social capital did not predict promotion rate, although social capital mediated the relationship between race and psychosocial support. Black managers reported having less social capital than whites, and social capital, in turn, was positively related to the receipt of psychosocial support. No differences were found between blacks and whites in their receipt of career-related support.</p>
            <p>Critics have argued that organization theories which "work" are obvious to practitioners; that is, the theories simply confirm relationships that are already well understood by experienced managers. In our study, four types of respondents-Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) with business school education, CEOs without such education, graduating MBA students, and liberal arts graduate students-were presented with theory-based performance-rating tasks. These tasks identified respondents' beliefs regarding high-performance alignments of business-level strategy, structure, and environment for manufacturing firms. The respondents' cause maps were then compared to one another and to the alignment-performance relationships prescribed by business-level contingency theory. The graduating MBAs' cause maps reflected contingency theory most closely. The MBAs' cause maps were much closer to prescriptions of the theory, however, than were those of either the liberal arts graduate students or the experienced CEOs. This suggests that business-level contingency theory is not obvious to educated laypersons, or to highly experienced practitioners; both groups would find that the theory disconfirms aspects of their causal expectations. Further, each of the four respondent types in our study emphasized different contingency factors during the decision-making exercise. We discuss these results and their implications.</p>
            <p>Harmful interpersonal behavior at work has generally been studied from the perspective of perpetrators. In contrast, theories of victimization suggest that other factors may also determine why certain individuals are more frequently harmed than others. For example, there may be situational factors that contribute to an environment that allows or fails to inhibit harmful actions. Other incidents of workplace harm may be consciously or unconsciously influenced by the victims themselves. This empirical study extends previous research on harmful workplace behavior by examining whether the situational variable of job status and the dispositional characteristics of aggressiveness and negative affectivity predict self-perceived victimization. Based on research in criminal victimology, we hypothesized that an employee's job status would be significantly related to perceived victimization. Research on victims of bullying was the basis for the predicted effects of negative affectivity and aggressiveness. Data were provided by a randomly selected sample of employees from a city government who completed a survey as part of an organizational assessment. We performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on employee responses to develop suitable measures of victimization. The analyses revealed that perceived victimization took either direct (e.g., name-calling) or indirect (e.g., sabotaging work) forms. Hierarchical regression was used to test the study hypotheses. Results showed that job status did not significantly influence perceived victimization. However, employees who were high in aggressiveness and negative affectivity perceived higher levels of victimization than those who were low in these traits. Implications for organizations are discussed and future research directions are offered.</p>
            <p>Employees are motivated intrinsically as well as extrinsically. Intrinsic motivation is crucial when tacit knowledge in and between teams must be transferred. Organizational forms enable different kinds of motivation and have different capacities to generate and transfer tacit knowledge. Since knowledge generation and transfer are essential for a firm's sustainable competitive advantage, we ask specifically what kinds of motivation are needed to generate and transfer tacit knowledge, as opposed to explicit knowledge.</p>
            <p>Relationships and interactions should be an important focus of attention in organizational scholarship. In contrast to traditional research approaches that focus on independent, discrete entities, methodologies oriented to relational concerns in organizations allow researchers to study the intersubjective and interdependent nature of organizational life. In addition to providing historical and philosophical bases for a perspective which emphasizes relationality, we review the growing number of methods that capture relational aspects of organizational life. Examples include network analysis, and "complexity" modeling, correspondence analysis and participatory research, case study methods, the learning history approach, psychometrics, and action inquiry. Our goal is to establish a "palette" of methodological choices for the researcher interested in operationalizing a relational perspective within organizational research/practice.</p>
            <p>Two studies were conducted to further explore the organizational and economic insights provided by the Cyert-March duopoly model (C-M) described in A Behavioral Theory of the Firm (ABTOF, Cyert and March 1963). Study 1 examined the extent to which two firms that differed solely in the decision behavior of a routine would also differ in organizational (quasiresolution of conflict, uncertainty avoidance, problem-driven search, and organizational learning) and economic (profit, price, market share, cost) measures and impacts. Three such manipulations were separately examined, where each manipulation altered the relative propensity of the firm to be more or less reactive to three events: production growth pressure, price adjustment under organizational goal conflict, and initial price adjustment under profit goal failure. Analysis of the behaviors revealed how subtle changes in these key routines could generate complex organizational and economic effects that impact firm success. The dominant result demonstrated that organizations that did not perform well organizationally did not perform well economically. In addition, higher reactivity resulted in higher costs, in part because of quantified organizational constructs (e.g., slack, pressure). Study 2 examined the data from the first study to determine the extent to which the performance of the duopoly was consistent with a set of eight stylized economic facts drawn from the empirical literature on oligopoly. Study 2 demonstrated consistency with five of the eight stylized economic facts and provided partial support for two others. We conclude that behavioral constructs of ABTOF, as articulated in the Cyert-March duopoly model, provide behavior and performance capabilities that bridge the gap between game-theoretic models of duopoly and the computational and informational realities of organizations.</p>
            <p>The central claim of this paper is that organization studies needs to be fundamentally reshaped. Such change is needed to provide room for ethics and to increase the relevance of research. We argue that the new pragmatism provides critical resources for this change. Pragmatism is a particularly helpful tool to use in that it highlights the moral dimensions of organizing (is this useful for our purposes?) while at the same time avoiding entrenched epistemological distinctions that marginalize ethics and make research less useful. The paper begins by discussing the relative absence of ethics within the mainstream of organization studies, indicates why this relative absence is problematic, and proceeds to show how pragmatism offers a preferable approach. Epistemology-specifically the debate between positivists and anti-positivists-becomes a central issue because the framework of positivism is overtly hostile to ethics (and other nonquantitative approaches to studying organizations), rendering it a marginal subject. While anti-positivism holds promise for overcoming this hostility towards ethics, it retains some of the destructive elements of positivism that create new and equally troubling difficulties. The paper claims, in contrast to the proposals of others (e.g., Zald's 1993 position) that the preferred alternative is not to split the difference, but to move beyond the positivism vs. antipositivism debate and work from an alternative framework. Pragmatism allows researchers to put this debate to the side and, in the process, develop research that is focused on serving human purposes-i.e., both morally rich and useful to organizations and the communities in which they operate.</p>
            <p>A conceptual challenge in exploring the role of trust in interorganizational exchange is translating an inherently individual-level concept-trust-to the organizational-level outcome of performance. We define interpersonal and interorganizational trust as distinct constructs and draw on theories of interorganizational relations to derive a model of exchange performance. Specifically, we investigate the role of trust in interfirm exchange at two levels of analysis and assess its effects on negotiation costs, conflict, and ultimately performance. Propositions were tested with data from a sample of 107 buyer-supplier interfirm relationships in the electrical equipment manufacturing industry using a structural equation model. The results indicate that interpersonal and interorganizational trust are related but distinct constructs, and play different roles in affecting negotiation processes and exchange performance. Further, the hypotheses linking trust to performance receive some support, although the precise nature of the link is somewhat different than initially proposed. Overall, the results show that trust in interorganizational exchange relations clearly matters.</p>
            <p>Recent innovations in organizational forms, such as delayered management, empowered workers, telework, and ad hoc work groups, have created a need to ensure that communication between dispersed knowledge workers can be supported. The movement toward a less cohesive workplace suggests a need to deploy computer-based media, but it is not clear which media should be deployed and under what circumstances. Addressing such significant issues must begin with insights into why knowledge workers choose particular media for particular tasks in the first place. Prior research theorizing about media choice has focused on: (1) task, (2) medium, (3) the fit between task and medium, and (4) social environment. It has not sufficiently considered the role of the availability of the intended recipient or the interaction between recipient availability and task social presence variables which could have a significant impact on media choice. To examine the effects of these two factors, the authors conducted an initial exploratory study and a subsequent controlled factor study. In the initial study, an analysis of 1,669 hypothetical scenarios from 100 knowledge workers at a worldwide transportation company indicated that social presence (SP) theory proves to be a good predictor of media choice, as does the recipient availability construct. The analysis also suggested that the interaction between recipient availability and task social presence might be a good predictor. With a partial replication, randomized treatment design, including 1,883 scenarios from 257 workers, the controlled factor study at a large financial institution generally confirmed the study hypotheses. The authors examine rival explanations simultaneously along the dimensions of task, medium, fit between task and medium, and social environment. They propose and test a new model of media choice and suggest directions for future testing of a new "task closure" model of media choice. They conclude by offering guidelines for managers deploying electronic communications in the workplace.</p>
            <p>The authors develop theory for predicting the distribution of decision making between the corporate and business-unit levels of management for a subset of information systems (IS) resources referred to as systems development. Drawing on literature from the fields of MIS, strategic management, and organization theory, they first determine how potentially influential context factors are likely to affect the locus of the lead decision-making role from a multiple-contingencies perspective. Then they theorize how conflicting corporate and business-unit contingencies are likely to be resolved. They present a set of six propositions that predict a centralized, decentralized, or compromise design solution for a given business unit on the basis of (1) business-level strategy, (2) whether or not information technology (IT) plays a strategic role for the business unit, (3) the degree of line managers' IT knowledge at the business-unit level, and (4) the level at which opportunities for IT-related synergies across business units are being pursued at the corporate level.</p>
            <p>Forces that set in motion a strategic decision making process were uncovered from 352 strategic decisions. Decision making was initiated by claims from stakeholders that pointed out salient concerns and difficulties and prompted directions to be set that guided a search for ways to respond. The study identified the types of claims and directions that prompted action and how these claims and directions influenced decision making success, looking for best practices. Success improved when claims were performance based and when the search for alternatives was directed by agreed upon performance expectations. Success declined when claims and directions inadvertently limited search or framed the strategic choice as an action to be taken.</p>
            <p>Many writers advocate interorganizational collaboration as a solution to a range of organizational and intersectoral problems. Accordingly, they often concentrate on its functional aspects. We argue that collaboration deserves a more critical examination, particularly when the interests of stakeholders conflict and the balance of power between them is unequal. Using examples from a study of the UK refugee system, we argue that collaboration is only one of several possible strategies of engagement used by organizations as they try to manage the interorganizational domain in which they operate. In this paper, we discuss four such strategies: collaboration, compliance, contention and contestation. By examining the stakeholders in the domain and asking who has formal authority, who controls key resources, and who is able to discursively manage legitimacy, researchers are in a stronger position to evaluate both the benefits and costs of these strategies and to differentiate more clearly between strategies that are truly collaborative and strategies that are not. In other words, we hope to demonstrate that collaboration between organizations is not necessarily "good", conflict is not necessarily "bad", and surface dynamics are not necessarily an accurate representation of what is going on beneath.</p>
            <p>Much current work on organizational knowledge, intellectual capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the "epistemology of possession," since it treats knowledge as something people possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing found in individual and group practice. Knowing as action calls for an "epistemology of practice." Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups. Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right. Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit, individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation. Harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these concepts make possible a more robust framing of such epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these views through three brief case studies drawn from recent research.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a theory of firm boundaries based on fore-knowledge development and exploitation in speculative or "informed" trading. Foreign exchange trading provides this study's empirical context. From research on information economics, we suggest optimal speculative trading operations are multiunit and globally dispersed. Alternatively, transaction cost economics suggests atomistic actors prevail in the market for fungible commodities like currencies. We also develop competing hypotheses about information technology's effects on foreign exchange trading operations. Speculation arguments predict that the global scope of trading operations will expand after the introduction of generic information technologies. Transaction cost economics proposes that, when atomistic actors do not prevail, trading operations will contract after this introduction. We test competing predictions with models of the expansion, contraction, and net change in a firm's global dispersion. We estimate these models with data from the population of banks worldwide engaged in interbank foreign exchange currency (FX) trading from 1974 to 1993. Our results uncover two types of firms: those that approach the atomistic actor of transaction cost economics, and those that resemble the globally dispersed multiunit configuration from our speculation discussion. These results encourage reflection on how the theory of the firm differs when firms trade to produce versus speculate.</p>
            <p>Organizational adaptation to competition often means inventing or adopting a process innovation and the daunting challenge of implementing it. Increasingly, process innovations rely on the capabilities embedded in an organization's IT infrastructure. Successfully implementing an IT-enabled process innovation depends largely on how a project's IT and work process designs fit and evolve with this IT infrastructure. However, little empirical research guides the formulation of IT and work process strategies. This study addresses the question: How does the degree of coupling between a redesign project's IT strategy and work process strategy affect project performance? Data collection utilized a multistage research design employing comprehensive phone interviews and matched surveys among three sets of respondents (project managers, IT managers, and process users) across 43 process redesign projects in the health care industry. Our findings indicate project performance improves with tightly coupled IT and work process strategies when implementing process inventions, and with loosely coupled strategies when implementing imitations.</p>
            <p>Utilizing a model drawn from both transaction cost economics and social exchange theory, we analyze determinants of strategic flexibility in a sample of strategic alliances involved in joint development agreements or joint research pacts. Findings indicate that, in general, determinants suggested by transaction cost economics provided flexibility in modification and inflexibility in exit. From social exchange theory, trust was found to be positively related to both types of flexibility while another component of social exchange theory, dependence, was found to be negatively related to the strategic flexibility of the alliance. Results also found that factors suggested by both transaction cost economic theory and social exchange theory were related to the concept of trust. Economic constraints as suggested by transaction cost economics were positively related to trust between the alliance partners while dependence was negatively related to trust. Additionally, the quality of communication and the existence of shared values were positively related to trust between the exchange partners. Results provide support for the role of determinants from both transaction cost economics and social exchange theory in the flexibility of strategic alliances.</p>
            <p>It is well established that the existence of investments specific to a relationship influences the choice of governance structure, including the use of contractual safeguards. What is less well understood are the circumstances leading to the creation of those specific assets to begin with. This paper explores the industrial buyer's motives to put itself at risk by making investments, tangible and intangible, which cannot be readily redeployed from one supplier to another. Using original data from a sample of 388 supply relationships involving all automakers in the U.S. and Japan, we examine features of the supply task, the supplier, and the supply environment which serve as motives to make supplier-specific investments. We also examine potential factors which facilitate the posting of specific assets as "credible commitments" to attenuate supplier opportunism. We find that specific investments by buyers serve as a mechanism to 1) increase coordination when the manufacturing task is complex, 2) buffer the buyer against technological uncertainty, and 3) build close relationships when the requisite production skills are scarce (the supply market is thin). We find more specific investments in supply arrangements that are embedded in a broader business relationship. We find fewer supplier-specific investments in the Japanese context. Finally, we find that buyers focus their investments on lesser-known, low-share component makers, perhaps to capitalize on a unique, focused supplier capability.</p>
            <p>When organizations pay inadequate attention to unusual events, the possibility of breaching a safety barrier increases. With hindsight it often appears that full advantage is not taken of what is known. Part of the reason organizations neglect apparent warnings is because of limited resources and the way resources are allocated. Drawing on concepts from the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, this paper examines situations where resource availability and use can compromise safety by initiating drift. Empirical evidence from the nuclear power industry is reviewed to demonstrate the relationship between resources, resource deployment, and drift. Drift is influenced by error signals, feedback loops, and imperfect watchfulness. Resource availability and use can initiate drift, but they do not necessarily yield catastrophe. Should organizations fall into a threatened position, they can enlist characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities to stabilize the situation, avoid breaching the safety border, and achieve greater security. Through an in-depth study of two plants with contrasting reputations for safety, this paper identifies the characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities that organizations on the edge exhibit. The characteristics, behaviors, and capabilities of the plant with the stronger safety reputation changed after a significant reduction of resources. Resource reduction led to movement toward the safety border, which in turn led to change. Evidence shows that organizations operating closer to the border of safety respond to warnings from unusual events in a resilient rather than anticipatory way. To overcome unexpected problems and limitations, they rely on after-the-fact intervention rather than preparation, foresight, and the provision of countermeasures. Once they recognize they have problems, they explore for novel approaches, typically seeking new knowledge and skills by dismissing old staff and hiring new people, buying advice from outside experts or consultants, and modeling, benchmarking, and copying other organizations' best practices. Organizations on the edge initiate change in response to external demands for change often only after painful public incidents. These organizations emphasize hierarchy and powerful headquarters staff, and their leaders tend to act as commanders and controllers rather than as catalysts and facilitators. The focus of this paper is not on the occurrence of accidents per se, nor on highly reliable operations, but on the precursors and consequences of drift within a safety border. Operating on the edge of the border extends beyond safety to other performance measures and beyond nuclear power to other industries. In settings as diverse as U.S. banks, hospitals, and universities, Israeli kibbutzim, Japanese kereitsu, and Korean chaebol, operating on the edge has become more common.</p>
            <p>The adoption of telecommuting raises concerns for both managers and employees: Remote supervision presents monitoring challenges, while physical isolation may impede the employee's opportunity for, and involvement in, determining valued organizational outcomes (organizational justice). This study of 191 employees examined the relationships among telecommuting, organizational monitoring strategies, and organizational justice perceptions. Results suggest that monitoring strategies were more strongly associated with organizational justice perceptions than with telecommuting, and procedural and interactional justice perceptions related significantly to telecommuting. We provide implications, limitations, and ideas for future research.</p>
            <p>Through examination of transcripts of the first five leadership succession discussions that occurred in a work group designed to empower teachers we explored dynamics and dilemmas associated with women leading a women's group based on feminist principles. We addressed three research questions: How is leadership, as reflected in leadership succession processes, experienced in such a group? What dynamics are associated with leadership succession in this type of group? What are outcomes of the process for members? Results indicated that the experience of leadership shifted considerably during the first six years of the group, with reflective images of leadership moving from the mythical to the pragmatic, from the powerful to the less powerful. Dynamics evolved in ways that were partially consistent and partially inconsistent with organizational life-cycle literature. The group experienced ambivalence and tension surrounding the type of authority given to designated leaders. Members dealt with discomfort by shifting the focus of the group coordinator's attention to external relations and by rotating internal leadership responsibilities. This approach resolved tensions associated with authority and increased members' senses of their own power, even as it decreased the range of initiative-taking that was implicitly allowable within the group. This analysis of leadership succession in a women's group with an empowerment agenda offers a salient case for the study of dilemmas likely to be present in many change efforts. Its results suggest that attempting to resolve contradictions and tensions is less helpful than acknowledging them and working within them.</p>
            <p>In this paper I claim that organizational routines have a great potential for change even though they are often perceived, even defined, as unchanging. I present descriptions of routines that change as participants respond to outcomes of previous iterations of a routine. Based on the changes in these routines I propose a performative model of organizational routines. This model suggests that there is an internal dynamic to routines that can promote continuous change. The internal dynamic is based on the inclusion of routine participants as agents. When we do not separate the people who are doing the routines from the routine, we can see routines as a richer phenomenon. Change occurs as a result of participants' reflections on and reactions to various outcomes of previous iterations of the routine. This perspective introduces agency into the notion of routine. Agency is important for understanding the role of organizational routines in learning and in processes of institutionalization.</p>
            <p>Whereas most prior research on the learning curve has focused on improvements in efficiency, this paper deals with the impact of learning on product quality. The key data are measures of automobile reliability published in Consumer Reports. Analysis yields three findings: (1) Quality improves over the production life of a car model with the same kind of regularity as an efficiency learning curve. Thus, there is a quality learning curve. (2) Unlike in the efficiency domain, however, learning in the domain of product reliability is primarily a function of time, and not of how many cars have gone down the assembly line. Thus, quality depends not on the accumulation of production experience per se, but on the intensity of "off-line" quality improvement activities and on the transfer of knowledge from the general environment over time. (3) In contrast to the traditional injunction, "do not buy a new car in its first year of production," the opposite advice actually seems to apply: In any given year, the newest car models have the best quality. That is, new car-model designs typically include significant quality improvements that are more than enough to outweigh any disruption created in manufacturing by the new model's introduction and that even surpass the incremental improvements made to older, existing car models.</p>
            <p>Research in organizational communication has examined the structure and content of interaction, but has paid little attention to research traditions outside the organizational sciences that explore the social-psychological interconnections between relationship development and interaction. In this paper we draw upon and extend those traditions to develop a model of how communication relationships develop within organizational dyads. The proposed model examines organization-based communication relationships through a synthesis of theoretical perspectives on communication richness, relational communication, interpersonal attribution, and social expectancy. We also call upon precepts of structuration theory to embed these microlevel processes in an organizational context. The relational outcome in the model is "interactional richness," a dyad-level construct that assesses the extent to which communication within the dyad is high in shared meaning. Model antecedents are aspects of interaction through which communicators reciprocally define their relationships, including relational message properties, message patterns that emerge over time, and relational perceptions. We propose that these communication properties and behaviors give rise to relationship attributions. We then incorporate processes of expectancy confirmation and violation to explain how specific communication encounters lead individuals to reformulate attributions regarding the status of a given relationship. Research propositions articulate how attribution/expectancy processes mediate between relational communication behavior and relationship development outcomes. We also develop propositions addressing how relational communication behavior is influenced by macrolevel factors, including hierarchy, structure, and culture. In a concluding section we discuss the model's potential contribution to research and practice, address its limitations, and offer recommendations for future research aimed at testing its embedded hypotheses.</p>
            <p>In a series of interviews, organizational researchers acknowledged the key role of time in social inquiry, and their tendency to exclude it in practice. The discrepancy between what researchers think about the incorporation of temporal factors in their research and what they actually do was explained by various pragmatic, methodological, and normative grounds, but they were not aware of other epistemological and ontological barriers related to their choice. The interviews also drew attention to a paradox that stemmed from an experience of ongoing tension between the methodologically prescribed sense of time and the experientially lived impression of time. Further analysis suggests that incorporation of time factors may significantly improve social process research. The study demonstrates that temporal elements do not merely change one's perception of a situation, but also provide a space for a richer and more meaningful interpretation by enabling an improved association of a particular event with one's personal frame of reference and lived experience. In addition, the study suggests that an awareness of the various approaches to time and the application of a consistent ontological framework to the analysis of social phenomena are likely to increase the coherence and congruity of the analysis. No particular perception of time is prescribed here. The emphasis is on self-awareness of the implications of temporalities on social phenomena and on ontological consistency in our research.</p>
            <p>With the increasing globalization of business, there has been growing interest in how to create and manage a successful international enterprise. Although researchers and practitioners have grappled with the issue of globalization for some time, there is no one model that encompasses the range of phenomena we observe in the global economy, nor have those models that do exist been precisely formalized. This paper provides an expanded approach to thinking about the organizational forms and linkages that exist in international business operations. Building on the popular integration-responsiveness framework of international strategic orientation, we develop a more expansive approach that is better able to account for the diversity of organizational forms and strategic choices open to managers. By adding a third set of environmental pressures, incorporating the beliefs of managers, and by employing the idea of efficient frontiers, we reformulate the integration-responsiveness framework, making it more consistent with modern economic models of the firm. Our integration-responsiveness-completeness (IRC) model argues that global firms can respond to these fundamental and competing pressures by configuring themselves in a variety of ways-rather than normatively prescribing that the transnational form is optimal. In addition, our model has methodological ramifications. Its formal structure suggests that empirical techniques that focus on the best rather than average performance are necessary to adequately investigate the performance differences among alternative organizational forms. This may explain the paradoxical lack of empirical support for a link between organizational form and performance.</p>
            <p>To describe human action as purely the product of rational calculation leaves unanswered the question of how human beings can act in the absence of any structure for calculating the likely outcome of their actions. If the answer is that they cannot, how can any such structure be stable and comprehensive enough to enable action without becoming either inert or deterministic? In this paper, we seek to understand how free will and social context can interact to produce both structure and action. This is accomplished through the development of a framework based on the notion of convention. Organizations, in this view, are grounded in "effort conventions" of what constitutes "normal" effort at work, that structure the action of those who work within the organization, and in turn reinforce these structures. We show how humans can calculate within a context of socially constructed beliefs, and how these beliefs can evolve, provided that they remain essentially nonjustified and beyond the reach of rational calculation. It is this mix of rational calculation and nonrational beliefs that form the core of our model. We begin by defining the nature of a convention and its properties. We then describe the evolutionary dynamics of conventions, and show that conventions exist in competition with other conventions and evolve over time. Our model of convention is then linked to other notions, advanced in the managerial literature, which point to a kind of `deep structure' that lies at the heart of organizations. We conclude by outlining how this notion can shed new light on the analysis of organizations.</p>
            <p>Postmodernism, an intellectual movement that originated in the humanities, has received considerable attention in the organization theory literature. Because many scholars remain uncertain as to just what this controversial perspective is, the present article offers a straightforward explanation of postmodernism's basic themes. Additionally, the author attempts to provide some balance to the overwhelmingly sympathetic presentations of postmodernism in the organization theory literature by offering a critical assessment of how it would redirect the study of organizations. Consistent with an intellectual divide dating to the Enlightenment, while those engaged in "normal science" are concerned with the question of what is true, it appears that those who sympathize with postmodernism are addressing the question of what is good. Postmodernists, it is argued here, wish to engage in advocacy for values and preferences that they view as putting them in radical opposition to the status quo. To facilitate such advocacy they call for the repudiation of "modernism," in particular the key modernist notion that there is an objective truth that can be sought out rationally and systematically. Postmodernists adopt, instead, a relativist philosophy, which contends that "truth" must be considered merely subjective, such that one's view of truth is only relative to one's circumstances. Although taking the position that no one can say what is or is not "true" puts them in opposition to mainstream science, it supports their ability to discredit views they oppose, and simultaneously provides a defense against those who would claim that the postmodernist's view is not "true." Whether the postmodernist approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of organizations is addressed here by examining its philosophical and historical roots, the research and theory that it has so far inspired, and the critical commentary on our field that its adherents have offered.</p>
            <p>Like Weiss, I too dislike some of the postmodern writings on organizations. I too worry that shallow works given even more shallow and opportunistic readings can have negative social consequences. But I also recognize that most of Weiss's concerns are not unique to postmodern writings. Many of the problems he discusses could also be descriptive of work from different conceptual and methodological stances. Statistics are often contrived and misleading. Ethnography has at times aided colonization. Both social and physical sciences have at times produced bad theories and been put to very negative uses. Some early postmodernist theorists, Christians, and scientists, were Nazis, and elements of each of their fundamental conceptions could be co-opted to support this particular form of barbarism. This potential utilization, however, does not lead for me to a blanket condemnation of postmodernism, science, ethnography, religion, or statistics. Devotees of each have used their special understandings to fight tyranny. Both postmodernism and science also draw on fundamental conceptions that are productive, enable open choices, and help us see through the masters and ideologies of a particular time and place. I am less interested in blame than in finding what each can contribute. I look to an ongoing community discussion that helps us to do the best we can to sort out the good from the bad, and I hope that the current set of essays helps stimulate a positive dialogue.</p>
            <p>Mergers and acquisitions are complex events in organizational life for which we have incomplete understanding, in part because researchers have tended to consider only partial explanations of them. The authors addressed that problem by developing a conceptual framework that integrates theoretical perspectives from economics, finance, and especially strategy, organization theory, and human resource management to offer a broader process-oriented integrative model. The integrative model explicitly describes how synergy realization is a function of the similarity and complementarity of the two merging businesses (combination potential), the extent of interaction and co-ordination during the organizational integration process, and the lack of employee resistance to the combined entity. The approach differs from traditional methods of studying mergers and acquisitions in three ways: (1) the success of a merger or acquisition is gauged by the degree of synergy realization rather than more removed and potentially ambiguous criteria such as accounting or market returns; (2) the key attribute of combination potential is conceptualized not only in terms of the similarities present across businesses, as in most studies of mergers and acquisitions, but also in terms of the production and marketing complementarities between the two businesses; and (3) the data are derived from a case survey method that combines the richness of in-depth case studies with the breadth and generalizability of large-sample empirical investigations. The framework was tested empirically across a sample of 61 mergers and acquisitions. The extent to which a merger or acquisition resulted in synergistic benefits was related to the strategic potential of the combination, the degree of organizational integration after the deal was completed, and the lack of employee resistance to the integration of the joining firms. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that (1) independent of any similarities across joining firms, the presence of complementary operations increased the probability of acquisition success by boosting synergy realization, (2) organizational integration was the single most important factor in explaining synergy realization, even to the extent that M&amp;As with high combination potential were significantly more successful when coupled with high organizational integration than when integration efforts were less forceful, and (3) mergers and acquisitions that were dependent on gains from combining similar production and marketing operations tended to elicit more resistance from employees than M&amp;As focused on realizing complementary benefits. Overall, the findings provide strong support for an integrative theory of mergers and acquisitions.</p>
            <p>The authors analyze the coercive and mimetic conditions leading to the establishment of investor relations departments among Fortune 500 industrial firms during the 1984-1994 period. The results show that antimanagement resolutions brought to a vote by social movement activists significantly contributed to the establishment of investor relations departments. Intense scrutiny by financial analysts also impelled firms to create such departments. Whereas social movement activists framed shareholder rights as a problem and compelled organizations to uphold them, professional analysts subtly coerced organizations to signal their commitment to investor rights by creating boundary-spanning structures. That solution was transmitted through board interlocks to other organizations.</p>
            <p>This article seeks to reconceptualize the relationship between flexibility and efficiency. Much organization theory argues that efficiency requires bureaucracy, that bureaucracy impedes flexibility, and that organizations therefore confront a tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility. Some researchers have challenged this line of reasoning, arguing that organizations can shift the efficiency/flexibility tradeoff to attain both superior efficiency and superior flexibility. Others have pointed out numerous obstacles to successfully shifting the tradeoff. Seeking to advance our understanding of these obstacles and how they might be overcome, we analyze an auto assembly plant that appears to be far above average industry performance in both efficiency and flexibility. NUMMI, a Toyota subsidiary located in Fremont, California, relied on a highly bureaucratic organization to achieve its high efficiency. Analyzing two recent major model changes, we find that NUMMI used four mechanisms to support its exceptional flexibility/efficiency combination. First, metaroutines (routines for changing other routines) facilitated the efficient performance of nonroutine tasks. Second, both workers and suppliers contributed to nonroutine tasks while they worked in routine production. Third, routine and nonroutine tasks were separated temporally, and workers switched sequentially between them. Finally, novel forms of organizational partitioning enabled differentiated subunits to work in parallel on routine and nonroutine tasks. NUMMI's success with these four mechanisms depended on several features of the broader organizational context, most notably training, trust, and leadership.</p>
            <p>Although downsizing has become an integral part of organizational life in the U.S., there is little serious theoretical or empirical work on this issue. Nearly all of the completed work addresses the effects of downsizing, which usually are negative. Therefore, an important yet unanswered question is: Why do organizations downsize in the first place? In addressing this question, I offer some systematic thoughts on the causes of downsizing. Specifically, I develop a conceptual framework for studying organizational innovation that draws on two over-looked dimensions associated with this phenomenon, the basis of social action (rational versus arational) and social context (organizational versus extraorganizational). I then characterize downsizing as an organizational innovation and develop propositions that explain why organizations downsize. Finally, I emphasize that empirical evaluation of these propositions will help us to understand a pivotal organizational development of recent decades.</p>
            <p>In a study of how an R&amp;D group in a Japanese firm adopted and used a new electronic medium, we identified two contrasting patterns of use: the use of community-wide communication types, or genres, deliberately shaped by the action of a small, sanctioned group of mediators; and the use of local genres tacitly shaped by members within their own research teams. We suggest that these patterns reflect the more general processes of explicit and implicit structuring, resulting in both the reinforcement and change of social interaction within communities. Explicit structuring included the planned replication, planned modification, and opportunistic modification of existing genres, while implicit structuring included the migration and variation of existing genres. We believe that these two processes provide suggestive models for understanding the initial and ongoing use of new electronic media within a community.</p>
            <p>This research addresses the tensions that arise between the collection and use of personal information that people provide in the course of most consumer transactions, and privacy. In today's electronic world, the competitive strategies of successful firms increasingly depend on vast amounts of customer data. Ironically, the same information practices that provide value to organizations also raise privacy concerns for individuals. This study hypothesized that organizations can address these privacy concerns and gain business advantage through customer retention by observing procedural fairness: customers will be willing to disclose personal information and have that information subsequently used to create consumer profiles for business use when there are fair procedures in place to protect individual privacy. Because customer relationships are characterized by social distance, customers must depend on strangers to act on their behalf. Procedural fairness serves as an intermediary to build trust when interchangeable organizational agents exercise considerable delegated power on behalf of customers who cannot specify or constrain their behavior. Our hypothesis was supported as we found that when customers are explicitly told that fair information practices are employed, privacy concerns do not distinguish consumers who are willing to be profiled from those who are unwilling to have their personal information used in this way.</p>
            <p>This article reports partial results of an eight-year field study of the Top Management Teams (TMTs) of a global multidivisional financial services corporation and compares those results with large-sample work in the TMT literature. In particular, it investigates the operationalization of TMT cognitive diversity by the proxies of age, team tenure, industry experience, and functional background heterogeneity most often used in statistical work, and compares those operationalizations with cognitive diversity itself. In addition to highlighting which proxies seemed to most closely approximate cognitive diversity and why, it demonstrates the confounding impact of power on all operationalizations. A comparison of the field results with three representative studies with respect to the operationalization of the dependent variables of diversification, innovation, and performance helps to explain why previous TMT heterogeneity research has often produced inconsistent results or nonfindings. It offers some suggestions that should improve the robustness of statistical research and demonstrates the reciprocal usefulness of case and large-sample research.</p>
            <p>The literature on the management of R&amp;D professionals strongly advocates managing R&amp;D projects on a project-by-project basis. This literature suggests that projects should be managed differently depending upon project characteristics such as risk, ambiguity, and nonroutineness. While the primary emphasis of the R&amp;D professional literature has been on project teams, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of organization-wide controls on innovativeness at the firm level. In a sample of 57 pharmaceutical firms, this study investigates the influence of organizational controls on the research and development activities of R&amp;D professionals. This study is one of a handful of studies that simultaneously explores the use of input, behavior, and output controls. Two categories of innovation are considered as dependent variables: incremental innovations in the form of drug enhancements and radical innovations in the form of new drugs. Contrary to existing theory and hypotheses developed in this study, the results show that input, behavior, and output control enhanced radical innovation, and input and output controls enhanced incremental innovation. These results challenge several important features of existing models of R&amp;D management and diverge from common beliefs about R&amp;D management at the project level. While it is commonly accepted that incremental and radical innovation should be managed differently, the results of this study suggest otherwise. In this instance, the management of R&amp;D activities may be considered more similar than previously thought.</p>
            <p>Empirical research indicates that more than half of strategic alliances fail, and the outcomes of alliance failure can be devastating. Despite the increased concern about managing strategic alliances, the field still lacks a theoretical framework to describe the conditions and dynamics leading to the failure of strategic alliances. This paper attempts to distill, derive, and integrate theories across different disciplines into a unified framework that offers a better understanding of alliance failure. The conceptual framework focuses on two primary sources of alliance failure: interfirm rivalry and managerial complexity. We propose that strategic alliances fail because of the opportunistic hazards as each partner tries to maximize its own individual interests instead of collaborative interests. Also, strategic alliances fail because of the difficulties in coordinating two independent firms (i.e., coordination costs), and in aligning operations at the alliance level with parent firms' long-term goals (i.e., agency costs). The paper extends the theoretical framework by looking into a process model of alliance development and failure.</p>
            <p>This article develops a concept of an alignment between market and entrepreneurship orientations and reports the results of a study designed to investigate its effect on a firm's product innovation. A sample of 181 firms was classified into four categories labeled as market/entrepreneurship orientation (ME), entrepreneurship orientation (EO), market-oriented (MO), and conservative (CO) firms. One-way ANOVA and planned contrast tests (PCT) were used to identify whether or not specific product innovation decisions, activities, and performance vary across the groups. The results indicate that these groups of firms significantly differ with respect to both subjective and objective measures of new product performance, and with product innovation strategies and activities pertaining to timing of market entry, product quality, marketing synergy, proficiency of market launch, and management support for innovation. Further, the findings suggest that these groups of firms are not significantly different with respect to perceived environmental hostility and intensity of market competition. This finding suggests that the groups of firms are robust across environments and that the findings presented in this study are not an artifact of environmental variation. Managerial and research implications of the results are discussed.</p>
            <p>In this essay we argue that organization theory's effort to make sense of postbureaucratic organizing is hampered by a dearth of detailed studies of work. We review the history of organization theory to show that, in the past, studies of work provided an empirical foundation for theories of bureaucracy, and explain how such research became marginalized or ignored. We then discuss methodological requirements for reintegrating work studies into organization theory and indicate what the conceptual payoffs of such integration might be. These payoffs include breaking new conceptual ground, resolving theoretical puzzles, envisioning organizing processes, and revitalizing old concepts.</p>
            <p>This paper considers the impacts of different investments in human capital (firm-specific versus generalized investments) on employee commitment to the firm. The resource-based literature has stressed that only firm-specific human capital is likely to generate organizational rents, since those assets are more likely to be inimitable, rare, and therefore a better basis for sustained competitive advantage. Generalized investments in human capital (i.e., investments in capabilities that people can transfer and deploy to other firms or settings) are to be avoided. However, observing lessons from the literature on psychological contracts and organizational commitment, we argue that generalized investments may have value for the firm through their effects on worker commitment to the firm. The gain in worker commitment is valuable to firms given the fragile state of the contemporary employment relation, in which the lack of job security is likely to breed diminished employee commitment. This is particularly a concern for employment relations consisting of externalized labor (i.e., contract work or self-employed professionals operating as agents of the firm), in which agent commitment is vital but likely to be more scarce. In this paper we focus on the externalized workers (independent agents) of two insurance firms in addressing these issues. A sample of 237 agents shows support for the benefits of generalized investments on agent commitment, questioning conventional wisdom that such investments should be avoided. We also examine the impact of relation-specific investments and other key antecedents on agent commitment, concluding that a mixture of strategic investments in human capital should be considered, taking into account their impacts on the firm-worker psychological contract. We also examine the impact of agent commitment on agent performance in this context, finding committed agents do provide greater value to the insurer.</p>
            <p>Demography research rarely examines the black box within which the cognitive diversity of the top management team is assumed to affect firm performance. Using data from 35 simulated firms run by a total of 159 managers attending executive education programs, the current research tested several hypotheses concerned with (a) the relationship between demographic and cognitive team diversity and (b) the reciprocal effects of diversity and firm performance. Results showed that members of high-performing teams tended to preserve multiple interpretations early in the team's life cycle, but that they moved toward greater clarity near the end of the life cycle. These high-performing teams, therefore, exhibited both early interpretative ambiguity and late heedful interrelating. Cognitive diversity in teams affected and was affected by changes in firm performance. Surprisingly, there was no evidence of any effect of demographic diversity on measures of cognitive diversity.</p>
            <p>The 1990s have seen a resurgence of interest in information privacy. Public opinion surveys show that many citizens are becoming greatly concerned about threats to their information privacy, with levels of such concern reaching all-time highs. Perhaps as a response to the growing concerns of citizens, the media are devoting more attention to privacy issues, and governmental regulation of the corporate privacy environment is increasing in many countries. Almost all developed countries have grappled with the trade-offs between open access to information-which enables economic efficiency-and an individual's right to privacy. Consistent with these trade-offs, many recent incidents suggest that regulatory approaches to information privacy, corporate management of personal data, and consumer reactions are becoming tightly interwoven around the world. To provide some insights into these relationships, we develop a conceptual model and test it with a cross-cultural sample from 19 different countries. In general, we find that a country's regulatory approach to the corporate management of information privacy is affected by its cultural values and by individuals' information privacy concerns. In addition, as governments become more involved in the corporate management of information privacy, internal management of such issues seems to tighten. This result supports previous observations that most firms take a primarily reactive approach to managing privacy by waiting for an external threat before crafting cohesive policies that confront their information practices. Moreover, when corporations are not perceived to adequately manage information privacy issues, and/or when privacy concerns rise, individuals are more inclined to prefer government intervention and be distrustful of firm self-regulation. As such, citizens may look to lawmakers to enact stricter regulation to reduce their privacy concerns. These findings and several international trends suggest that the self-regulatory model of privacy governance may not be sustainable over the long term. Findings from this research constitute an important contribution to the emerging theoretical base of information privacy research and should be particularly enlightening to those managing information privacy issues. Several directions for future research are also discussed.</p>
            <p>Diversification not only internalizes transactions of goods and services, but it also internalizes transactions of capital. Hence, the value of diversification will depend, inter alia, on whether internal capital markets are relatively efficient or inefficient. This essay reviews and discusses the possible benefits and costs of internal capital markets by conducting a careful comparative institutional analysis. The essay concludes that internal capital markets can add value to lines of business only under a limited number of circumstances. Some recent developments in the organization of internal capital markets in diversified firms can be understood as attempts to increase their efficiency.</p>
            <p>The instabilities of strategic alliances have been examined in the literature through a number of theoretical approaches. Alliance instabilities refer to major changes or dissolutions of alliances that are unplanned from the perspective of one or more partners. Although the literature identifies certain characteristics of strategic alliances that may lead to their unplanned dissolution, the extent of our understanding of this subject appears to be fragmented and incomplete. In this article we propose a comprehensive framework for adequately understanding alliance instabilities based on the notion of internal tensions. We suggest that strategic alliances are sites in which conflicting forces develop and which can be viewed as being constituted by three key pairs of competing forces-namely, cooperation versus competition, rigidity versus flexibility, and short-term versus long-term orientation. This tensions framework helps us in explaining the intrinsic vulnerability of alliances in terms of a wide range of internal contradictions and enables us to examine, in an integrated manner, the incidence, dynamics, and eventual dissipation of the inherent instabilities. We discuss the interrelationships among the different internal tensions and their impacts on different types of strategic alliances. We also examine the termination of alliances through mergers/acquisitions and dissolution. Finally, we suggest ways to empirically test the various ideas and propositions developed here and indicate directions for further research.</p>
            <p>In this research, we address the question: Why do many total quality management implementations fail? We develop a theoretical model in which the total quality management role for line employees results in a dual work design that requires both standardized production and continuous improvement. We propose that workers effectively integrate both types of work by switching, defined as shifting between standardized production and continuous work while on the job in response to situational cues. Alternatively, workers can respond to the challenges of a job involving both types of work by avoiding the continuous improvement work. Switching and avoidance are associated with different performance and attitudinal outcomes. We present evidence drawn from an exploratory field study which suggests that line employees who effectively integrate standardized production and continuous improvement work by switching experienced less job stress and greater job satisfaction. Moreover, plants which were more effective in total quality management performance had a greater proportion of line employees using switching.</p>
            <p>This paper seeks to engage the organization theory community in contemporary debates over the role of the corporation in American society by using the case of the Saturn corporation to develop and illustrate a stakeholder theory of the firm. One normative and three positive questions are posed for a stakeholder theory: The normative question is: Why should stakeholder models be given serious consideration at this moment in history? The positive questions are: (1) Under what conditions is a stakeholder firm likely to emerge in the United States, (2) what are the critical determinants of performance in a stakeholder firm, and (3) what will determine the sustainability and diffusion of this organizational form in the American environment? The history, design features, and dynamics of the labor-management partnership at Saturn are used to illustrate and interpret a specific case of employees as stakeholders. Saturn's original mission, governance structure, and internal processes fit the characteristics of a stakeholder firm. Employees establish themselves as influential, definitive stakeholders by using their knowledge to improve organizational performance. The local union likewise contributes to firm performance by organizing workers into a dense social network that contributes to problem solving, conflict resolution, and quality improvement. However, the legal and political environment in which the firm operates produces considerable uncertainty over the sustainability and diffusion of Saturn's features in particular, and the stakeholder organizational form in general. Additional hypotheses and research questions are proposed to continue theory building around the more general model of the stakeholder firm. Researchers are encouraged to take up the analysis of stakeholder models and thereby contribute to the contemporary and future debates over the role of the corporation in American society.</p>
            <p>Organizational scholars have shown considerable interest in the rise of complex systems of organizational control, sometimes referred to metaphorically as the process of tightening the iron cage, as well as patterns of workplace resistance to it. More recently, the scholarly spotlight seems to have shifted from formal modes of employee resistance to more informal or routine forms of workplace resistance. This paper presents a detailed ethnographic account of informal resistance and its ability to limit managerial control in a health maintenance organization undergoing the computerization of its administrative functions. Our study adopts a more problematic approach to understanding routine resistance, tracing its discursive constitution in the workplace. Using the findings of an ethnographic study involving observation and interviews, we show how routine resistance was discursively constituted and how it limited organizational control in interesting and unexpected ways. This discursive constitution was achieved through (a) owning resistance, (b) naming resistance, and (c) designating indirect resistance. The paper also analyzes how these different discursive constructions limited managerial control by affirming autonomous self-identities, renegotiating roles and relationships, and reinterpreting dominant managerial discourses. Finally, broader implications for understanding routine resistance in organizations are drawn.</p>
            <p>As both technologies and organizations undergo dramatic changes in form and function, organizational researchers are increasingly turning to concepts of innovation, emergence, and improvisation to help explain the new ways of organizing and using technology evident in practice. With a similar intent, I propose an extension to the structurational perspective on technology that develops a practice lens to examine how people, as they interact with a technology in their ongoing practices, enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Viewing the use of technology as a process of enactment enables a deeper understanding of the constitutive role of social practices in the ongoing use and change of technologies in the workplace. After developing this lens, I offer an example of its use in research, and then suggest some implications for the study of technology in organizations.</p>
            <p>Individuals in general management, marketing, production, and customer service undertake corporate political roles of championing and antagonism in support of or opposition to research and development (R&amp;D) projects. R&amp;D personnel see these champions acting politically because they favor projects that align more closely with the firm's business interests than with its specific technologies. Champions find resources and protect their projects from termination; however, they are equally likely to support high and low performing projects. These results contradict many of the commonly held beliefs in research literature about champions. Antagonists, in a role of friendly opposition, appear to react to the presence of champions and do not appear to affect resources or project termination.</p>
            <p>Before technological change leads to new processes, products, markets, or ways of organizing, entrepreneurs must discover opportunities in which to exploit the new technology. To date, research has not explained adequately why entrepreneurs discover these opportunities, which creates several conceptual problems in the entrepreneurship literature. Drawing on Austrian economics, I argue that opportunity discovery is a function of the distribution of information in society (Hayek 1945). Through in-depth case studies of eight sets of entrepreneurs who exploit a single MIT invention, I show that entrepreneurs discover opportunities related to the information that they already possess. I use these findings to draw several implications that differ from those prevailing in the entrepreneurship literature, including: (1) entrepreneurs do not always select between alternative market opportunities for new technologies; (2) the source of entrepreneurship lies in differences in information about opportunities; (3) the results of prior studies of entrepreneurial exploitation may suffer from bias; and (4) individual differences influence the opportunities that people discover, how their entrepreneurial efforts are organized, and how the government can influence this process.</p>
            <p>The author questions the possibility of establishing invariant laws for social phenomena and presents an argument for the case study method. Despite the many alleged advantages of the case study method, its validity remains in doubt. Various concepts and techniques have been developed to make the method rigorous enough to meet the stringent criteria of nomothetical social science, but it often fails to meet two of them: (1) reliability and replicability, and (2) external validity. Those two criteria can be met only when social researchers find an invariant law. The author examines whether those two criteria are really necessary and attempts to clarify the conditions under which they are relevant, that is, the conditions under which an invariant law can be discovered in social phenomena. He argues that the conditions are so stringent that the search for an invariant law should not be the main objective of management studies, and he contends that reliability/replicability and external validity are irrelevant not only for the case study, but for any method of management studies. Without those two criteria, the validity of the case study can be forcefully reasserted. The author concludes by suggesting that serious consideration be given to whether the objective of management studies should be changed from a search for invariant laws of practical use to the encouragement of reflective dialogue in society.</p>
            <p>Analyses of the events that occur in the context of organization process are rapidly advancing. Scholars holding otherwise disparate views share the sense that social actors, including organizations, attend to, interpret, and act upon events. Analyses of events are converging from two theoretical and methodological starting points. Analyses that emphasize human subjectivity and contextual specificity are seeking increased cross-situational learning. Nomothetic analyses are building on their strength in cross-situational learning by striving to represent the way subjects themselves construct events in relation to context. Rather than continuing to analyze classic organizational and environmental dimensions like formalization, general uncertainty, munificence, and stability, scholars are increasingly analyzing the qualities of events and the meanings they are given. They are treating events as elements that social actors abstract from social processes, and social actors as parties who interact to give events meaning. The present paper defines event analyzes its origins and current uses, and indicates how using and going beyond lessons from physics can promote organization studies. These lessons come from the analysis of physical events as particles in relation to waves, fields, and perspectives. The uniquely social element of potential takes us beyond the experience of physical science.</p>
            <p>Agency theorists argue that organizations typically get little value from using employees and that they should instead use nonemployees operating fully as residual claimants. Yet, even in a context where those theorists would predict virtually no employees-taxicab organizations-they are common. What drives the use of employment relationships in these organizations? The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation. The theoretical arguments and findings suggest what organizations gain by having employment relationships and show that integrating the agency theoretic argument with the other theoretical arguments leads toward a resource-based view of strategy and human resources. The authors highlight the importance of embedding arguments on the internal management of human resources in the strategic and competitive context in which organizations operate. Their arguments also have implications for the resource-based approach to strategy in mapping the resource space of human assets in organizations and, within that space, directing attention to how organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage through managing human resources.</p>
            <p>The existing literature on the relationship between strategy and structure tends to ignore the legal dimension of the organization of diversified firms. Yet, there is considerable variation in the legal organization of diversified firms; while some of these firms are organized as simple corporations, many are organized as "corporate groups" in which certain lines of business are organized as separate, subsidiary firms. In this paper we argue that this variation in legal organization is observed because legal organization can significantly affect firm value. In particular, forming subsidiary firms to accommodate new businesses can protect the outstanding stakeholders of a diversified firm from increases in bankruptcy risk and liability exposure. However, forming subsidiary firms also reduces economies of scope. Hence, there are offsetting costs and benefits to adopting different types of legal organization. Changes in these relative costs and benefits over time can also be expected to trigger changes in legal organization, as well as the divestiture of businesses characterized by particular types of economic hazards.</p>
            <p>Existing theory and research on organizational impression management focuses on how spokespersons use remedial tactics, following image-threatening events, to put their organization in the best possible light. By contrast, little theory or research has considered how organizations use impression management tactics to avert undesirable responses to upcoming events. This paper uses a qualitative and inductive study of billing procedures at three large hospitals to develop theory about how organization members use impression management tactics to fend off specific, expected challenges to organizational practices that are ambiguously negative. We found that hospitals use anticipatory impression management tactics to: (1) distract, diminish, or overwhelm patients' attention to hospital charges; and (2) to induce emotions that lead patients to simplify their information processing of those charges. Hospitals appear to use such anticipatory obfuscations both to fend off patients' initial challenges and to prevent their existing challenges from escalating. We discuss these findings in terms of their contributions to theories of symbolic management, social influence, and routine service encounters.</p>
            <p>The authors test whether acquisitions and divestitures are related to environmental uncertainty and diversification strategy. Drawing from transaction cost economics, they predicted that increases in environmental uncertainty would reduce a company's ability to manage its subsidiaries efficiently and would lead to divestiture. Conversely, they predicted that decreases in environmental uncertainty would enable a company to manage its subsidiaries more efficiently and would lead to acquisition. Those predictions were expected to be strongest for firms with intermediate levels of diversification, as such firms are believed to be the most difficult to manage efficiently. Repeated measures analyses of a panel of 164 Fortune 500 companies supported the predictions for highly diversified firms (e.g., unrelated businesses) only. Less diversified firms reacted to increases in uncertainty by acquiring and to decreases in uncertainty by divesting. The results suggest that the relationship between diversification strategy and portfolio restructuring depends on environmental uncertainty. In addition, the study findings imply that there may be limits in the hierarchy's governance efficiency in relation to market modes and that those limits may be affected by environmental uncertainty and diversification strategy.</p>
            <p>This article is written in the spirit of resistance, as a challenge and alternative to what are accepted as neutral, unbiased conceptualizations of stress and burnout within traditional and popular discourse. Findings reported in a previous study suggest that the ways we conceptualize and experience stress and burnout are not inherently neutral, but are shaped by culture and a particular set of dominant themes prevalent in organizational and professional discourse. This article exposes the processes by which some forms of organizational experience and knowledge related to stress and burnout have become dominant, whereas "other" forms have become marginal and suppressed. Through a postmodern feminist reading of stress and burnout as expressed within the medical and organizational discourses, the author reveals how gender acts as an axis of power and meaning that helps sustain dominant and seemingly neutral conceptualizations within the discourses. Building from the feminist reading, she develops a radical reconstruction of the ways organizational participants and theorists could interpret and experience stress related emotions, and discusses the cultural conditions that could produce and sustain such a revision. The reading and revision reveal ways in which experiences of stress and burnout have been shaped and constrained by the dominant discourse and suggest ways social scientists might rewrite those experiences toward more humane ends. Insofar as stress and burnout are among the most common and well-researched topics (and emotions) within the field of organizational behavior, this paper has far-reaching theoretical, epistemological, and practical implications. More generally, the feminist reading and revision open new spaces for other ways of theorizing and argues against the limitations of knowledge and experience imposed by traditional organizational theory and medical discourse.</p>
            <p>This study of Swedish workers investigates gender wage inequality, specifically, whether earnings are affected by the gender composition of establishments' managerial and supervisory staff. Theoretical arguments focus on managers' propensity to create and maintain or to undermine institutionalized gender bias and employees' capacity to mobilize resources and establish claims in the wage distribution process, mainly through social networks. Results show that gender-differentiated access to organizational power structures is essential in explaining women's relatively low wages. Women who work in establishments in which relatively many of the managers are men have lower wages than women with similar qualifications and job demands in establishments with more women in the power structure.</p>

            <p>This study examines the influence of the social network of board interlocks on strategic alliance formation. Our theoretical framework suggests how board interlock ties to other firms can increase or decrease the likelihood of alliance formation, depending on the content of relationships between CEOs (chief executive officers) and outside directors. Results suggest that CEO-board relationships characterized by independent board control reduce the likelihood of alliance formation by prompting distrust between corporate leaders, while CEO-board cooperation in strategic decision making appears to promote alliance formation by enhancing trust. The findings also show how the effects of direct interlock ties are amplified further by third-party network ties.</p>

            <p>This paper tests predictions from institutional and rational perspectives about the adoption of organizational practices through a comparative study of human resource management in firms located in six European countries. Distinguishing between calculative practices-aimed at efficient use of human resources-and collaborative practices-aimed at promoting the goals of both employees and employer-the paper predicts differences in adoption across countries. Results show that institutional determinants, as indicated by the national embeddedness of firms, have a strong effect on the application of both calculative and collaborative human resource management practices. Firm size, a rational determinant, has a considerable impact on calculative practices, whereas the effect of industrial embeddedness is quite modest for both practices.</p>
            <p>We develop a conceptual model of the circulation of corporate control-the instability in formal authority at the top of large corporations. According to our model, chief executive officer (CEO) selection is both a political contest for the top executive position and an ideological struggle among members of the firm's political coalition over defining the corporate agenda and strategy. We apply the model to analyze the selection of functional back-grounds of 275 new CEOs in large U.S. manufacturing firms from 1981 to 1992. Results show that the circulation of control adds to previous explanations based on strategic contingencies and institutional isomorphism. Furthermore, we find evidence of an ideological and political obsolescence of financial CEOs and a change in the strategic contingencies that previously favored finance and the financial conception of control. Results suggest that conceptions of control are best understood as styles, rather than institutions, as these conceptions are neither taken for granted nor isomorphic across industries or the manufacturing sector, but are subject to sectoral variation, contestation, and change.</p>

            <p>This paper examines how a producer's status in the market influences its choices about product quality, and the outcomes that result. We compare economic models of reputation that emphasize the role of past quality as a source of information about current quality with sociological models of status that emphasize the role of affiliations. We test hypotheses about the complementary effects of status and reputation in an analysis of more than 10,000 affiliation decisions made by 595 wineries over a 10-year period. Results show that actors occupying high-status positions obtain greater benefit from subsequent high-status affiliations than do actors occupying low-status positions. As such, these actors are more willing and able to pay for subsequent high-status affiliations and to use them to advance their position in the larger status ordering.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the consequences of changes in the organization's market position on its market share, testing arguments of inertia and regression toward the mean and taking into account recent methodological critiques of studies on the consequences of organizational change. A study of format change in the U.S. radio industry, 1984-1992, shows that changes cause performance to decline, as inertia theory predicts, but this is moderated by organizational size and performance before the change, so change can be beneficial for low-performing organizations but may be harmful for large and successful organizations.</p>
            <p>This article tests hypotheses about the effects of social networks on inequitable salary negotiation outcomes using a U.S. high-technology company's salary negotiation data for 1985-1995. Analyzing results of 3,062 actual salary negotiations, we found that members of racial minority groups negotiated significantly lower salary increases than majority members, but this effect was dramatically reduced when we controlled for social ties to the organization. Having a social tie to the organization significantly increased salary negotiation outcomes, and minorities were less likely than majority members to have such a social tie.</p>
            <p>We investigate the effect of community-wide political and ideological interests on the failure rate of Israeli workers' cooperatives. Political order may be provided by the state or through membership in a federation. Independently, both conditions should reduce organizational failure, but when they coexist, the influence of the state should dominate due to its comparative advantages as a supplier of order. Organizations that represent rival ideologies cause ideological competition, which should increase failure, while organizations that represent shared ideologies cause ideological mutualism, which should decrease failure. The context of Israeli workers' cooperatives provides a natural laboratory for testing these ideas, as it spans the formation of the Israeli state. It also includes a powerful federation, the Histadrut, to which many cooperatives belonged, as well as significant populations of organizations representing both capitalist and socialist ideologies. The analysis supports all of the above arguments, indicating the relevance of interdependence, broadly defined, for the evolution of organizational populations.</p>

            <p>This paper uses data on radio format changes to test hypotheses on innovations as catalysts for nonmimetic change in organizations. Innovations are difficult to interpret using existing schemata, causing organizations to search for information on the opportunities and threats implicit in observed innovations. Such search may lead to mimetic adoption of the innovation or, more likely, to more varied nonmimetic change. Results show an effect of innovations on the rate of nonmimetic change in radio markets, with innovations in large or nearby markets having greater effect and innovations by large organizations having less effect. The social and competitive relations of the innovator to a given organization are thus modifiers of the catalytic effect. These findings have implications for theories of innovation, competition, and organizational isomorphism.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the relationship between organizational aging and innovation processes to illuminate the dynamics of high-technology industries, as well to resolve debates in organizational theory about the effects of aging on organizational functioning. We test hypotheses based on two seemingly contradictory consequences of aging for organizational innovation: that aging is associated with increases in firms' rates of innovation and that the difficulties of keeping pace with incessant external developments causes firms' innovative outputs to become obsolete relative to the most current environmental demands. These seemingly contradictory outcomes are intimately related and reflect inherent trade-offs in organizational learning and innovation processes. Multiple longitudinal analyses of the relationship between firm age and patenting behavior in the semiconductor and biotechnology industries lend support to these arguments.</p>

            <p>We used computer simulations to examine the role and interrelationship between search processes that are forward-looking, based on actors' cognitive map of action-outcome linkages, and those that are backward-looking, or experience based. Cognition was modeled as a simple, low-dimensional representation of a more complex, higher dimensional fitness landscape. Results show that, although crude, these representations still act as a powerful guide to initial search efforts and usefully constrain the direction of subsequent experiential search. Changing a cognitive representation itself can act as an important mode of adaptation, effectively resulting in the sequential allocation of attention to different facets of the environment. This virtue of shifting cognitive representation, however, may be offset by the loss of tacit knowledge associated with the prior cognition.</p>

            <p>Previous research has shown that procedural fairness and outcome favorability interactively combine to influence people's reactions to their social exchanges. The tendency for people to respond more positively when outcomes are more favorable is reduced when procedural fairness (how things happen) is relatively high. This paper evaluates whether cultural differences in people's tendencies to view themselves as interdependent or independent (their self-construal) moderate the interactive relationship between procedural fairness and outcome favorability. In three studies, participants indicated their reactions to an exchange with another party as a function of the other party's procedural fairness and the outcome favorability associated with the exchange. In Study 1, participants' national culture was treated as a proxy for their self-construal. In Study 2, people's national culture and self-construal were assessed. In Study 3, participants were classified on the basis of their self-construals. Converging evidence across studies showed that the interactive relationship between procedural fairness and outcome favorability was more pronounced among participants with more interdependent forms of self-construal.</p>
            <p>This paper examines how the place of banks in the inter-corporate network has changed as a result of their decreasing role as financial intermediaries in the U.S. economy. An analysis of comprehensive data on the boards of the fifty largest banks and their connections with the several hundred largest nonbank corporations from 1982 to 1994 shows that the centrality of banks has significantly declined as executives of major corporations, particularly those representing central firms, joined bank boards at a substantially lower rate. Declining centrality reflects a strategic choice on the part of the banks: as the returns available from lending to major corporations have declined, the largest banks have moved into other forms of business and reduced their recruiting of centrally located directors. We conclude with a discussion of the role of financial intermediation in shaping the social organization of the economy.</p>

            <p>The ethnographic study reported here examines executive maternity leave as a succession event that manifests itself in a novel transition pattern that I term "temporary executive succession." In a study of one entrepreneurial firm, I investigated what happens when a founder takes a maternity leave, specifically, how the initiating force of maternity influences the event and how members respond to a breach in "feminine" leadership. The ethnographic analysis revealed an emergent leadership change in the absence of a formal successor. While firm members professed their "feminine" approach to work, they invoked the founder's maternity to increase the firm's autonomy and revise the founder's role. The study brings critical, participatory qualitative methods to succession inquiry and casts doubt on the validity of dominant assumptions about executive succession, its initiating forces, stages of the process, and control. It also informs research on "feminine" styles of leading and the place of maternity in modern organizations.</p>

            <p>Unlike prior research on organizational age dependence, which has described entire populations as exhibiting a liability of newness, adolescence, or obsolescence, this study adopts a contingent view by considering the interactive effects of age and technology strategy. Distinctions are drawn between proprietary strategists, who use internally developed, firm-specific technologies, and standards-based strategists, whose technologies conform with open and publicly available specifications. Results of a study of the firms in the U.S. personal computer industry show that technology strategy had two important influences on aging. First, age dependence varied across strategies. For example, standards-based strategists exhibited a liability of adolescence in their failure rates, while proprietary strategists exhibited a liability of obsolescence. Second, the joint effects of age and strategy produced long-term trade-offs across different performance outcomes. For instance, rates of sales growth increased with age for proprietary strategists, yet so did their risks of failure. Overall, this study suggests that multiple patterns of age dependence may simultaneously exist within a single population.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates how the interorganizational networks of young companies affect their ability to acquire the resources necessary for survival and growth. We propose that, faced with great uncertainty about the quality of young companies, third parties rely on the prominence of the affiliates of those companies to make judgments about their quality and that young companies "endorsed" by prominent exchange partners will perform better than otherwise comparable ventures that lack prominent associates. Results of an empirical examination of the rate of initial public offering (IPO) and the market capitalization at IPO of the members of a large sample of venture-capital-backed biotechnology firms show that privately held biotech firms with prominent strategic alliance partners and organizational equity investors go to IPO faster and earn greater valuations at IPO than firms that lack such connections. We also empirically demonstrate that much of the benefit of having prominent affiliates stems from the transfer of status that is an inherent byproduct of interorganizational associations.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a model of team learning and tests it in a multimethod field study. It introduces the construct of team psychological safety-a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking-and models the effects of team psychological safety and team efficacy together on learning and performance in organizational work teams. Results of a study of 51 work teams in a manufacturing company, measuring antecedent, process, and outcome variables, show that team psychological safety is associated with learning behavior, but team efficacy is not, when controlling for team psychological safety. As predicted, learning behavior mediates between team psychological safety and team performance. The results support an integrative perspective in which both team structures, such as context support and team leader coaching, and shared beliefs shape team outcomes.</p>

            <p>This paper follows an institutional theory of action in exploring the consequences of formal and informal rules on the chief executive officer (CEO) succession process. An analysis of the competing risks of insider versus outsider CEO succession in U.S. industrial corporations provides evidence that boards rely on both past precedents and formal internal labor markets for executive succession and the selection of insiders versus outsiders as CEOs. To exclude alternative explanations that view rules as epiphenomenal, I examine the moderating effects of performance, late CEO departures, the founder's power, and board structure on reliance on rules. The results show substantial inertia in the rules of CEO succession, consistent with an institutionalized action perspective. The findings suggest that rules both enable and constrain board decision making.</p>

            <p>This study uses social movement concepts to explain the success and failure of actors in a network of relationships trying to influence policies on environmental issues in a small city. Results show that strategies to take action and mobilize others in a network of interorganizational relationships can vary depending on the social context, which consists of the political opportunity structure defined by government regulators, whether the actor faces opposition, and the actor's position in the network. Decisions to engage in strategies to try to influence government regulators directly, to use a broker to reach agreements with the opposition, or to form a coalition with actors in other organizations to influence government decision makers are affected by this social context. Results also show that even peripheral actors, usually assumed to be powerless in network studies, can influence policy if they use a direct-contact strategy and the political opportunity structure is favorable.</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on a radical change, in which organizations abandon an institutionalized template for arranging their core activities, that is likely to occur in organizational fields that have strong, local market forces and strong but heterogeneous institutional forces. We examine the role of market forces and heterogeneous institutional elements in promoting divergent change in core activities among all U.S. rural hospitals from 1984 to 1991. Results support the view that divergent change depends on both market forces (proximity to competitors, disadvantages in service mix) and institutional forces (state regulation, ownership and governance norms, and mimicry of models of divergent change).</p>

            <p>From a qualitative study of flight attendants volunteering as support providers in a peer-based employee assistance program, we derive a typology of the boundary management tactics used by peer-support providers to maintain a comfortable distance from help recipients and propose a grounded theory explaining providers' selection of tactics. After identifying two factors associated with tactic selection (personal experience and social structure), we demonstrate that support providers' cognitive orientations, or logics of action, mediate the relationship between these factors and tactic selection. We identify four types of support providers' logics of action and show how a provider's logic may predict his or her preference for a particular boundary management tactic.</p>
            <p>We investigate how individuals learn from imagined might-have-been scenarios. We hypothesize that individuals are more likely to learn when they have responded to an event with upward-directed, self-focused counterfactual thoughts, and, additionally, that this learning process is inhibited by accountability to organizational superiors. Support for these hypotheses was obtained in two studies that assessed learning by aviation pilots from the experience of near accidents. Study 1 analyzed counterfactual thoughts and lessons in narrative reports filed by experienced pilots after actual dangerous aviation incidents. Study 2 involved laboratory experiments in which college students operated a flight simulator under different conditions of organizational accountability.</p>

            <p>We examine acquisitions by multiunit chain organizations to determine why they acquire a particular target rather than others that are available to them and thus better understand chain growth. We advance experiential and vicarious learning processes as an explanation for chains' next spatial move. Our analysis of Ontario nursing home chains' acquisition location choices from 1971 to 1996 provides broad support for a learning perspective, demonstrating how experiential and vicarious processes shape and constrain the locations of chains' acquisitions. Experiential processes lead chains to replicate themselves by acquiring components geographically and organizationally similar to their own most recent and most similar prior acquisitions and their own current components. Vicarious processes lead chains to imitate location choices of other visible and comparable chains' most recent acquisitions, prior acquisitions nearest to potential targets, and their current components. Our study thus establishes organizational learning as a conceptual foundation for predicting the location of a chain's next acquisition and, more generally, the spatial expansion of chains over time.</p>
            <p>In this study we develop a model of how diversity in positive affect (PA) among group members influences individual attitudes, group processes, and group performance. We test the model on a sample of 62 U.S. top management teams. Greater affective fit between a team member and his or her group is related to more positive attitudes about group relations and perceptions of greater influence within the group. Results also suggest there is a negative relationship between a team's diversity in trait positive affect and both the chief executive officers' use of participatory decision making and financial performance. Exploratory analyses reveal that affectively diverse, low mean trait PA groups experienced the greatest task and emotional conflict and the least cooperation. Analyses of diversity in trait negative affect produced no significant results. We discuss the implications of our study for the group emotion, team composition, group performance, and top management team literatures.</p>

            <p>In this paper we present an integrative model of the relationships among diversity, conflict, and performance, and we test that model with a sample of 45 teams. Findings show that diversity shapes conflict and that conflict, in turn, shapes performance, but these linkages have subtleties. Functional background diversity drives task conflict, but multiple types of diversity drive emotional conflict. Race and tenure diversity are positively associated with emotional conflict, while age diversity is negatively associated with such conflict. Task routineness and group longevity moderate these relationships. Results further show that task conflict has more favorable effects on cognitive task performance than does emotional conflict. Overall, these patterns suggest a complex link between work group diversity and work group functioning.</p>

            <p>Drawing on work from behavioral learning theory in psychology, this study examines the influence of prior organizational acquisition experience on the performance of acquisitions. This theory, which examines both the conditions preceding organization events and organizational responses, predicts that experience effects may range from positive to negative. Consistent with this theory, data from 449 acquisitions show an overall U-shaped relationship between organization acquisition experience and acquisition performance. In addition, the more similar a firm's acquisition targets are to its prior targets, the better they perform. These findings suggest that relatively inexperienced acquirers, after making their first acquisition, inappropriately generalize acquisition experience to subsequent dissimilar acquisitions, while more experienced acquirers appropriately discriminate between their acquisitions. Behavioral learning theory, then, may enhance understanding of organization experience effects.</p>

            <p>This paper describes a qualitative study of how people use their time at work, why they use it this way, and whether their way of using time is optimal for them or their work groups. Results of a nine-month field study of the work practices of a software engineering team revealed that the group's collective use of time perpetuated its members' "time famine," a feeling of having too much to do and not enough time to do it. Engineers had difficulty getting their individual work done because they were constantly interrupted by others. A crisis mentality and a reward system based on individual heroics perpetuated this disruptive way of interacting. Altering the way software engineers used their time at work, however, enhanced their collective productivity. This research points toward a "sociology of work time," a framework integrating individuals' interdependent work patterns and the larger social and temporal contexts. The theoretical and practical implications of a sociology of work time are explored.</p>

            <p>This paper combines the concept of weak ties from social network research and the notion of complex knowledge to explain the role of weak ties in sharing knowledge across organization subunits in a multiunit organization. I use a network study of 120 new-product development projects undertaken by 41 divisions in a large electronics company to examine the task of developing new products in the least amount of time. Findings show that weak interunit ties help a project team search for useful knowledge in other subunits but impede the transfer of complex knowledge, which tends to require a strong tie between the two parties to a transfer. Having weak interunit ties speeds up projects when knowledge is not complex but slows them down when the knowledge to be transferred is highly complex. I discuss the implications of these findings for research on social networks and product innovation.</p>

            <p>We examine the blending of informational and political forces in organizational categorizations in the context of chief executive officer (CEO) compensation. By law, corporate boards are required to provide shareholders with annual justifications for their CEO pay allocations that contain an explicit performance comparison with a set of peer companies that are selected by the board. We collected and analyzed information on the industry membership of chosen peers from a 1993 sample of 280 members of the Standard and Poor's (S&amp;P) 500. Our results suggest that boards anchor their comparability judgments within a firm's primary industry, thus supporting the argument that boards' peer definitions center around commonsense industry categories. At the same time, however, we found that boards selectively define peers in self-protective ways, such that peer definitions are expanded beyond industry boundaries when firms perform poorly, industries perform well, CEOs are paid highly, and when shareholders are powerful and active.</p>
            <p>In this essay I advance two related theses. First, economic theory predicts that organizations will be a mess but not a mystery. Second, classic case studies conducted by organizational sociologists support this prediction. Fully articulating and defending these theses will require a book, so my goal here is simply to render them plausible. I begin by pointing toward the relevant economic theory and sociological evidence, but I devote the bulk of the essay to a particular example: I develop a formal economic model inspired by a passage from Michel Crozier's The Bureaucratic Phenomenon. I conclude by discussing the potential roles of formal economic modeling in organizational research.</p>

            <p>While accepting Robert Gibbons' case for the clarifying role of formal models, this comment explores the role of rational choice accounts in organizational settings-including the French example that Gibbons cites- whose context evolves in ways exogenous to the rational action of individuals. Articulation of economic and noneconomic concerns in situations in which context and action evolve together is suggested as the main theoretical goal, one that will require arguments more complex than those of current sociology or economics.</p>

            <p>Gibbons argues persuasively that economic modeling offers a useful set of tools that noneconomists may employ to good effect in their research on organizations. His arguments are even more persuasive if it is understood that this brand of modeling lends itself naturally to one of the key theoretical problems facing such researchers-the need for a theory of aggregation, sometimes called a theory of action. Such a theory is necessary to link the behavior of individuals with properties of collectivities, such as corporations. Gibbons demonstrates that organizations populated with utility-maximizing actors can nevertheless be characterized by political chicanery, foolishness, and structural inertia, all of which can be seen as kinds of "organizational messes." So building a macro theory on rationalist assumptions does not require one to ignore many of the phenomena that have interested organizations researchers in the past.</p>
            <p>Arguing that knowledge in the social sciences is socially constructed through the selective interpretation of major works, we examine the fate of a classic article in organizational theory, DiMaggio and Powell's 1983 essay on institutional isomorphism. We show that one aspect of this article, the discussion of mimetic isomorphism, has received attention disproportionate to its role in the essay. A detailed examination of 26 articles in which researchers attempted to operationalize various components of DiMaggio and Powell's model shows that measures used to capture one of their concepts could have served as valid measures of one of the others. Findings show that DiMaggio and Powell's thesis has become socially constructed, as authors have selectively appropriated aspects of the work that accord with prevalent discourse in the field, and that centrally located researchers in sociology and organizational behavior are more likely than other scholars to invoke this dominant interpretation of their article.</p>

            <p>Three studies are used to examine how surveillance and sanctioning systems affect cooperative behavior in dilemma situations. The first two studies demonstrate that a weak sanctioning system results in less cooperation than no sanctioning system; furthermore, results from the second study suggest that sanctions affect the type of decision people perceive they are making, prompting them to see it as a business rather than an ethical decision. The results from these studies are used to develop a theoretical model that postulates that the relationship between sanctions and cooperation is due to both a signaling effect, in which sanctions influence the type of decision that is perceived to be made, and a processing effect, in which the decision processing, including whether or not the strength of the sanction is considered, depends on the decision frame evoked. A third study provides support for the processing-effect hypothesis.</p>
            <p>This theory-development case study of the quality circle management fashion focuses on three features of management-knowledge entrepreneurs' discourse promoting or discrediting such fashions: its lifecycle, forces triggering stages in its lifecycle, and the type of collective learning it fostered. Results suggest, first, that variability in when different types of knowledge entrepreneurs begin, continue, and stop promoting fashions explains variability in their lifecycles; second, that historically unique conjunctions of forces, endogenous and exogenous to the management-fashion market, trigger and shape management fashions; and third, that emotionally charged, enthusiastic, and unreasoned discourse characterizes the upswings of management fashion waves, whereas more reasoned, unemotional, and qualified discourse characterizes their downswings, evidencing a pattern of superstitious collective learning.</p>

            <p>A multimethod field study of 92 workgroups explored the influence of three types of workgroup diversity (social category diversity, value diversity, and informational diversity) and two moderators (task type and task interdependence) on workgroup outcomes. Informational diversity positively influenced group performance, mediated by task conflict. Value and social category diversity, task complexity, and task interdependence all moderated this effect. Social category diversity positively influenced group member morale. Value diversity decreased satisfaction, intent to remain, and commitment to the group; relationship conflict mediated the effects of value diversity. We discuss the implications of these results for group leaders, managers, and organizations wishing to create and manage a diverse workforce successfully.</p>
            <p>This article describes how people adapt to new roles by experimenting with provisional selves that serve as trials for possible but not yet fully elaborated professional identities. Qualitative data collected from professionals in transition to more senior roles reveal that adaptation involves three basic tasks: (1) observing role models to identify potential identities, (2) experimenting with provisional selves, and (3) evaluating experiments against internal standards and external feedback. Choices within tasks are guided by an evolving repertory that includes images about the kind of professional one might become and the styles, skills, attitudes, and routines available to the person for constructing those identities. A conceptual framework is proposed in which individual and situational factors influence adaptation behaviors indirectly by shaping the repertory of possibilities that guides self-construction.</p>

            <p>Two qualitative studies examined the processes leading to the formation of breakaway organizations, which result when groups leave existing organizations to form new organizations. In the first study, analysis of interviews at 11 organizations in which group exit occurred revealed that the process unfolded in six stages: relative harmony, idea development, change, resistance, intense conflict, and exit. Five trigger events-introduction of conflicting ideas, legitimizing them, alarm, polarization of views, and justification-moved the participants through the group exit process. Study 2, conducted in three organizations in which group exit was avoided, revealed a trigger harmonizing event instead of a polarization event and a final dissonant harmony stage, instead of exit. Implications for the exit/voice/loyalty/neglect paradigm, the group studies literature, and organization theory in general are discussed</p>
            <p>This research examines mood as a collective property of work groups. We argue that work group members experience group moods when they can detect and display mood information through observable behavioral expressions. To test the hypothesis that work group moods are manifested behaviorally, we developed an observational instrument and compared observers' reports of work group mood with self-reported measures from 70 work groups. As predicted, groups converged for eight distinct mood categories, and observers' reports of work group mood were consistent with groups' aggregated self-reported values. Convergence in members' moods was positively associated with task and social interdependence, membership stability, and mood regulation norms. Theoretical and practical implications of work group mood are discussed.</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of contact between organizations in multiple geographic markets, focusing on two competitive behaviors: growth in current markets and entry into new markets. Drawing on sociological and economic theories, we propose that the extent of multimarket contact determines the level of competition experienced by a focal organization and therefore influences its growth and market entry. We also propose that market structure, specifically the extent to which markets are dominated by a few large firms, influences competition and therefore influences growth and market entry. Finally, we propose that market structure accentuates multimarket competitive dynamics, as mutual forbearance is more pronounced in markets dominated by a few large firms. Analysis of growth and market entry by a mixed population of multi- and single-market firms in the California savings and loan industry generally supports our model and shows that multipoint competition affects all rivals, multi- and single-market firms alike.</p>

            <p>Organizations derive their social identity from membership in formal groups and strive to maintain a positive social identity. When their social identity is threatened and group boundaries are permeable, organizations defect to other groups. This paper suggests that organizations receive identity-discrepant cues when in-group members defect to an out-group, but how organizations respond to such cues hinges on their social affiliations to the in-group, out-group, and defectors. A study of organizations that migrated from the NASDAQ stock market to the New York Stock Exchange reveals that strong ties to in-group members (NASDAQ members) reduced the impact of identity-discrepant cues and diminished defections. Conversely, strong ties to out-group members (NYSE members) enhanced the impact of identity-discrepant cues and increased defection. Proximity to defectors increased cross-overs-organizations followed defectors to whom they had direct ties. Implications for the study of embeddedness are outlined.</p>
            <p>The study reported here assessed the impact of managers' philosophies of human nature on their reactions to influential academic claims and counter-claims of when human judgment is likely to stray from rational-actor standards and of how organizations can correct these biases. Managers evaluated scenarios that depicted decision-making processes at micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis: alleged cognitive biases of individuals, strategies of structuring and coping with accountability relationships between supervisors and employees, and strategies that corporate entities use to cope with accountability demands from the broader society. Political ideology and cognitive style emerged as consistent predictors of the value spins that managers placed on decisions at all three levels of analysis. Specifically, conservative managers with strong preferences for cognitive closure were most likely (a) to defend simple heuristic-driven errors such as overattribution and overconfidence and to warn of the mirror-image mistakes of failing to hold people accountable and of diluting sound policies with irrelevant side-objectives; (b) to be skeptical of complex strategies of structuring or coping with accountability and to praise those who lay down clear rules and take decisive stands; (c) to prefer simple philosophies of corporate governance (the shareholder over stakeholder model) and to endorse organizational norms such as hierarchical filtering that reduce cognitive overload on top management by short-circuiting unnecessary argumentation. Intuitive theories of good judgment apparently cut across levels of analysis and are deeply grounded in personal epistemologies and political ideologies.</p>

            <p>This article reports a longitudinal examination and comparison of two multilateral networks of small and medium-sized firms in the U.S. wood-products manufacturing industry. The research focused on how each of these networks built legitimacy over the course of their early evolution, from the pre-network field, to initial formation and growth, and toward sustainment, culminating in the success of one and the demise of the other. Our findings demonstrate that despite differences in their early bases of support, which resulted in very different strategic emphases, the two networks ultimately had to address three conceptually distinct dimensions of legitimacy-the network as form, the network as entity, and the network as interaction. Based on the findings, we develop specific propositions and draw some tentative conclusions about how legitimacy is established in multilateral networks and how the failure to build legitimacy across the three dimensions may lead to network collapse.</p>
            <p>This study examines how the influence of directors who are demographic minorities on corporate boards is contingent on the prior experience of board members and the larger social structural context in which demographic differences are embedded. We assess the effects of minority status according to functional background, industry background, education, race, and gender for a large sample of corporate outside directors at Fortune/Forbes 500 companies. The results show that (1) the prior experience of minority directors in a minority role on other boards can enhance their ability to exert influence on the focal board, while the prior experience of minority directors in a majority role can reduce their influence; (2) the prior experience of majority directors in a minority role on other boards can enhance the influence of minority directors on the focal board, and (3) minority directors are more influential if they have direct or indirect social network ties to majority directors through common memberships on other boards. Results suggest that demographic minorities can avoid out-group biases that would otherwise minimize their influence when they have prior experience on other boards or social network ties to other directors that enable them to create the perception of similarity with the majority.</p>
            <p>This study examines how personal attachments between boundary spanners within cross-cultural international cooperative ventures (ICVs) are established and their association with venture performance. Results of analysis of 282 ICVs in an emerging market (People's Republic of China) show that the development of personal attachment depends on factors at three levels. At the individual level, attachment is an increasing function of overlap in tenure between boundary spanners. At the organizational level, attachment is heightened by goal congruity between the parent firms but is impeded by cultural distance. At the environmental level, market disturbance and regulatory deterrence lead to strong attachments. Such attachments stimulate an ICV's process performance and increase financial returns.</p>
            <p>This study examines firms' decoupling of informal practices from formally adopted policies through analysis of the implementation of stock repurchase programs by large U.S. corporations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when firms were experiencing external pressures to adopt policies that demonstrate corporate control over managerial behavior. We develop theory to explain variation in the responses of firms to such pressures, i.e., why some firms acquiesce by actually implementing stock repurchase programs, while others decouple formally adopted repurchase programs from actual corporate investments, so that the plans remain more symbolic than substantive. Results of a longitudinal study of stock repurchase programs over a six-year time period show that decoupling is more likely to occur when top executives have power over boards to avoid institutional pressures for change and when social structural or experiential factors enhance awareness among powerful actors of the potential for organizational decoupling. The study has implications for future research on decoupling, organizational learning, and corporate governance.</p>

            <p>This paper develops theory about the conditions under which cultural diversity enhances or detracts from work group functioning. From qualitative research in three culturally diverse organizations, we identified three different perspectives on workforce diversity: the integration-and-learning perspective, the access-and-legitimacy perspective, and the discrimination-and-fairness perspective. The perspective on diversity a work group held influenced how people expressed and managed tensions related to diversity, whether those who had been traditionally underrepresented in the organization felt respected and valued by their colleagues, and how people interpreted the meaning of their racial identity at work. These, in turn, had implications for how well the work group and its members functioned. All three perspectives on diversity had been successful in motivating managers to diversify their staffs, but only the integration-and-learning perspective provided the rationale and guidance needed to achieve sustained benefits from diversity. By identifying the conditions that intervene between the demographic composition of a work group and its functioning, our research helps to explain mixed results on the relationship between cultural diversity and work group out-comes.</p>

            <p>This paper develops a conceptual framework to explain different understandings of the concept of teamwork across national and organizational cultures. Five different metaphors for teamwork (military, sports, community, family, and associates) were derived from the language team members used during interviews in four different geographic locations of six multinational corporations. Results indicated that use of the teamwork metaphors varies across countries and organizations, after controlling for gender, team function, and total words in an interview. Analyses of specific relationships between national cultural values and categories of metaphor use and between dimensions of organizational culture and categories of metaphor use revealed patterns of expectations about team roles, scope, membership, and objectives that arise in different cultural contexts. We discuss the implications of this variance for future research on teams and the management of teams in multinational organizations.</p>
            <p>An inductive study of improvisation in new product development activities in two firms uncovered a variety of improvisational forms and the factors that shaped them. Embedded in the observations were two important linkages between organizational improvisation and learning. First, site observations led us to refine prior definitions of improvisation and view it as a distinct type of real-time, short-term learning. Second, observation revealed links between improvisation and long-term organizational learning. Improvisation interfered with some learning processes; it also sometimes played a role in long-term trial-and-error learning, and the firms displayed improvisational competencies. Our findings extend prior research on organizational improvisation and learning and provide a lens for research on entrepreneurship, technological innovation, and the fusion of unplanned change and order.</p>
            <p>To assess the effects of a firm's network of relations on innovation, this paper elaborates a theoretical framework that relates three aspects of a firm's ego network-direct ties, indirect ties, and structural holes (disconnections between a firm's partners)-to the firm's subsequent innovation output. It posits that direct and indirect ties both have a positive impact on innovation but that the impact of indirect ties is moderated by the number of a firm's direct ties. Structural holes are proposed to have both positive and negative influences on subsequent innovation. Results from a longitudinal study of firms in the international chemicals industry indicate support for the predictions on direct and indirect ties, but in the interfirm collaboration network, increasing structural holes has a negative effect on innovation. Among the implications for interorganizational network theory is that the optimal structure of interfirm networks depends on the objectives of the network members.</p>

            <p>An ethnographic study of distributors for Amway, a network marketing organization, examines the practices and processes involved in managing members' organizational identification. It shows that this organization manages identification by using two types of practices: sensebreaking practices that break down meaning and sensegiving practices that provide meaning. When both sensebreaking and sensegiving practices are successful, members positively identify with the organization. When either sensebreaking or sensegiving practices fail, members deidentify, disidentify, or experience ambivalent identification with the organization. A general model of identification management is posited, and implications for both theory and practice are offered.</p>

            <p>This research examines how the first organizations to abandon an institutionalized, taken-for-granted structure and adopt a radically different form presented the innovation to important stakeholders. A content analysis of hospitals' annual reports reveals that organizations that differed on other dimensions uniformly made preventive use of defensive impression management in announcing the change to a diversified corporate structure. The organizations invoked coercive and mimetic pressures to account for and justify the new structure, and they associated the innovation with legitimated organizational activities. The findings make two contributions that link the "old" institutionalism and neoinstitutionalism: they point to organizational agency in the preventive use of the very institutional forces that create isomorphism and suggest the presence of institutional forces even during the early stages of innovation.</p>
            <p>This paper examines some of the important organizational consequences of popular management techniques. Using informational reports on quality, empowerment, and teams, as well as a measure of the implementation of total quality management programs, we found that companies associated with popular management techniques did not have higher economic performance. Nevertheless, these same companies were more admired, perceived to be more innovative, and rated higher in management quality. Higher pay was also given to chief executives when their companies were associated with these management trends. These results provide strong support for institutional theory, demonstrating how both internal and external legitimacy can be gained by using popular management techniques. They also extend institutional theory from its usual emphasis on organization-environment relations to new within-firm dynamics.</p>
            <p>Structured interviews with 996 recently fired or laid-off workers provided data for analyses of the situational and psychological antecedents of both thinking about filing a wrongful-termination claim and actually filing such a claim. Potential antecedents were drawn from relational theories of organizational justice, economic theories about claiming, and sociolegal studies of claiming in other contexts. Wrongful-termination claims were most strongly correlated with the way workers felt they had been treated at the time of termination and with their expected winnings from such a claim. Structural equation model analyses of panel data from follow-up interviews with 163 respondents four months later showed that the psychological variables were, in fact, causal antecedents rather than consequences of claiming thoughts and actions. These findings support relational models of organizational justice and lead to practical suggestions for managing the termination process so as to avoid wrongful-termination suits.</p>

            <p>The issue of corporate control is examined through an analysis of the de-diversification activity of publicly held American firms from 1985 to 1994. Prominent accounts of such behavior depict newly powerful shareholders as having demanded a dismantling of the inefficient, highly diversified corporate strategies that arose in the late 1950s and the 1960s. This paper highlights an additional factor that spurred such divestiture: the need to present a coherent product identity in the stock market. It is argued that because they straddle the industry categories that investors-and securities analysts, who specialize by industry-use to compare like assets, diversified firms hinder efforts at valuing their shares. As a result, managers of such firms face pressure from analysts to de-diversify so that their stock is more easily understood. Results indicate that, in addition to such factors as weak economic performance, de-diversification is more likely when a firm's stock price is low and there is a significant mismatch between its corporate strategy and the identity attributed to the firm by analysts.</p>

            <p>The relatively recent explosion of information available in electronic forms makes attention, rather than information, the scarce resource in organizations. In this paper, we theorize about how suppliers of electronic information compete for this resource and use data on document database use in a management consulting company to show that document suppliers that occupied a crowded segment of the firm's internal knowledge market gained less attention from employees (measured as monthly use of their database) but were able to combat this negative competitive effect by being selective and concentrated in their document supply. This result reveals a paradox of information supply in competitive information markets: the less information a supplier offered, the more it was used, because the supplier developed a reputation for quality and focus. We suggest that this view of competition for attention can also be applied to the competition among Web sites in external information markets.</p>
            <p>In this paper, I examine how variation arises in the staffing of recycling programs at colleges and universities. Through initial fieldwork, I identified two basic recycling program forms. Some schools adopted recycling programs that entailed the creation of new, full-time recycling manager positions that were filled by ecological activists. Other schools adopted more minimalist programs that were staffed by current employees who were more ecologically ambivalent and assumed recycling management responsibilities as a part-time, additional duty. Results of a subsequent survey of a population of colleges and universities show that this variation in staffing was importantly shaped by the Student Environmental Action Coalition, a national social movement organization that provided resources and support to student environmental groups at particular schools. Implications for the study of how field-level organizations shape the content of organizational practices are discussed.</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes how a new field, independent (or non-utility) power production, was created by a federal mandate that electric utilities purchase power from private generating sources and how the field was populated. Results show that key rules that state regulatory bodies adopted or rejected regulating exchange between independent power producers and utilities were influential predictors of organizational foundings. Results also show that collective action by independent power producers boosted foundings. Finally, if the preexisting relationship between utilities and regulators was one of accommodation, foundings were suppressed. The paper examines these results in view of economic and sociological perspectives on public policies, spotlighting the vital role of institutions in early population dynamics.</p>

            <p>This paper analyzes data on 461 large U.S. industrial corporations to determine the factors that led large firms to participate in the wave of diversifying acquisitions that peaked in the late 1960s. We elaborate and test a class theory of corporate acquisitions, maintaining that firms pursued acquisitions in this period when they were commanded by well-networked challengers who were central in elite social networks but relatively marginal with respect to social status, isolated from the resistance of established elites, and free from control of owning families. We also consider a wide range of factors highlighted by alternative accounts of acquisition likelihood, including resource dependence, institutional pressures, and principal-agent conflicts. The results provide support for our main theoretical arguments, even when controls related to alternative explanations are taken into account.</p>

            <p>This article examines how different personality types create and benefit from social networks in organizations. Using data from a 116-member high-technology firm, we tested how self-monitoring orientation and network position related to work performance. First, chameleon-like high self-monitors were more likely than true-to-themselves low self-monitors to occupy central positions in social networks. Second, for high (but not for low)self-monitors, longer service in the organization related to the occupancy of strategically advantageous network positions. Third, self-monitoring and centrality in social networks independently predicted individuals' workplace performance. The results paint a picture of people shaping the networks that constrain and enable performance.</p>

Previous Editors-in-Chief are acknowledged and thanked for the excellent jobs they have done and for the superb reputation that the journal developed under their leadership. Incoming Senior Editors and members of the Editorial Review Board are introduced and welcomed.

            <p>We contend that two important, nonrelational, features of formal interorganizational networks-geographic propinquity and organizational form-fundamentally alter the flow of information through a network. Within regional economies, contractual linkages among physically proximate organizations represent relatively transparent channels for information transfer because they are embedded in an ecology rich in informal and labor market transmission mechanisms. Similarly, we argue that the spillovers that result from proprietary alliances are a function of the institutional commitments and practices of members of the network. When the dominant nodes in an innovation network are committed to open regimes of information disclosure, the entire structure is characterized by less tightly monitored ties. The relative accessibility of knowledge transferred through contractual linkages to organizations determines whether innovation benefits accrue broadly to membership in a coherent network component or narrowly to centrality. We draw on novel network visualization methods and conditional fixed effects negative binomial regressions to test these arguments for human therapeutic biotechnology firms located in the Boston metropolitan area.</p>
            <p>We utilize research on alliance governance structures and on new product development to study how partners working under an existing alliance governance structure will organize a new product development project. Initially, we consider a contractual alliance doing multiple projects and argue that the critical organization decisions for any project are whether one or both partners should be involved, whether the partners should work with little or considerable interaction, and whether decision-making authority should reside in a project manager or be consensual. Based on the answers to these questions, we identify at least four viable project organization options. We next examine the option that would be selected under conditions involving the alliance's newness, whether a cooperative history exists, and the distribution of skills for the project. Under each condition, we compare the costs and benefits of the options with respect to the underlying transaction costs, potential for learning, and the ability to contribute to developing a social relations network. By allowing variations in time-to-market pressures, the tacit knowledge that a partner can obtain from the project, and the partners' need to work closely together on future projects, we can determine the points at which costs and benefits indicate a switch from one organization option to another. Finally, we indicate how to adjust the theory for it to apply to a contractual alliance doing only one project and to an institutional alliance such as a joint venture.</p>
            <p>Organizations increasingly set up multiteam projects for the development of highly complex products. While team research has emphasized the importance of team-internal processes for smaller scale projects, we know little about collaborative processes (especially between teams) in such large-scale projects. This study utilizes a multi-informant longitudinal research design on a product development project (39 teams, 36 months) in the European automotive industry investigating collaboration between and within teams. The results of the study demonstrate that interteam coordination, project commitment, and teamwork quality as rated by the team members at Time 1 (Month 12; end of concept phase) are significantly correlated to project managers' ratings of overall team performance at Time 3 (Month 36; end of project). The process variables measured at Time 2 (Month 24; end of design phase) display generally weaker correlations with team performance at Time 3. Multiple regression analyses further detail the effects of collaborative processes within and between teams on different measures of team performance (i.e., overall performance, quality, budget, schedule). The results show that collaborative processes during the project have predictive properties in regard to later team performance and can serve as early warning indicators. Furthermore, the results of this study provide support for our hypotheses predicting positive relationships between interteam coordination, project commitment, and teamwork quality. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.</p>
            <p>Using Van de Ven and Poole's (1995) extensive assessment of process theories as an intellectual scaffold, we review theoretical contributions to our understanding of alliance dynamics and process. It appears that of four generic theoretical engines, only three-life cycle, teleology, and evolution-are reasonably well covered in this literature. Process studies informed by a dialectical theory, however, appear to be markedly absent. We explore the characteristics and contributions of a dialectical lens in understanding interorganizational collaborations by invoking a longitudinal case study of a biotechnology-based alliance. The case illustrates the coevolutionary interchange of design and emergence, cooperation and competition, trust and vigilance, expansion and contraction, and control and autonomy. It also emphasizes the importance of treating alliances as heterogeneous phenomena, of alliance performance as subject to social construction, and of unintended consequences as a change agent. The emerging ontological, epistemological, and methodological implications of a dialectical perspective comprise a novel extension to the existing literature.</p>
            <p>This article examines a fundamental characteristic of modem organizations: the dynamics of exploitation and exploration in intra- and interorganizational learning processes. Exploitation is about creating reliability in experience, and thrives on productivity and refinement. Exploration is concerned with creating variety in experience, and thrives on experimentation and free association. The findings of a case study on product development within a leading Scandinavian software producer and its interorganizational collaborations with business partners suggest how experiential learning processes of exploitation and exploration within the organizations concerned generate interorganizational exploitation and exploration. Conversely, the data suggest how exploitation and exploration between the organizations generate intraorganizational exploitation and exploration. A conceptual framework describing the nature of such learning dynamics is proposed. This framework emphasizes that experiential learning is a driving force behind much intra- and interorganizational change in the form of transformations between exploitation and exploration.</p>
            <p>This paper develops the argument that institutional mechanisms support changes in organizational strategies in ways that contrast with the standard interpretation of institutional "iron cages" that pressure organizations to conform. We specify three institutional process mechanisms that support organizational change-dominant logic-consistent activity, external charters, and peer emulation-and we test these claims with longitudinal data on the emerging strategies in early U.S. intercollegiate athletics. We argue that the supporting institutional mechanisms affect the incorporation patterns of intercollegiate programs in basketball, ice hockey, and lacrosse over the period from the late nineteenth century to the present. The research strategy of examining the spread of three different sports programs, each a proxy for different strategies of resources and visibility, provides evidence on the comparative pattern of effects of the three institutional mechanisms. Results indicate that all three institutional support mechanisms affect the incorporation of the intercollegiate programs. Differences in the pattern of incorporation across the three strategies provide robust evidence for alternatives to a prevailing "iron cage" view of institutional pressures and constraints. These findings also reinforce the importance of specifying field-level mechanisms to supplement a focus on organization-level mechanisms.</p>
            <p>This article represents a contribution to the conceptualization of organizational complexity. The first part of the article relates the concept of complexity to the production tasks of the organization by deriving measures of the complexity of production and planning tasks within the organization. This move allows us to analyze organizational activities in terms of the computational complexity of the tasks that the organization carries out. Drawing on concepts from theoretical computer science, the article introduces a taxonomy of production tasks based on their computational complexity and shows how to use the notion of computational complexity to analyze organizational phenomena such as vertical integration disintegration, the choice between markets and organizations as performers of particular production tasks, and the internal partitioning of organizational tasks and activities. The article then relates the complexity of the production function of the organization to the ways in which organizations structure themselves. It attempts to bring theorizing about organizational behavior based on complexity theory closer to the conceptual realm of "mainstream" organization theory and to make the concepts of complexity theory more useful to empirical examinations of firm dynamics and organizational behavior.</p>
            <p>Special issues of scholarly journals have become more common during the last decade of management research. We review this trend and assess the effectiveness of special issues for knowledge dissemination. Methods include interviews with journal editors, compiling data on time to publication and on impact and quality of special issues for five mainstream management journals, and a case study chronicling the creation of the Organization Science special issue on "Knowledge, Knowing, and Organizations." The findings show that journal special issue articles appear to be published more quickly than regular issue articles (time to publication), and for three of the five journals there is a significant difference in impact (measured as citation counts per article) when special and regular issue articles are compared. Further, we find evidence of greater variation in the quality of special issue articles compared to regular issue articles, although this reflects special issues publishing exceptional articles rather than the inclusion of substandard ones. The case analysis suggests that a series of preconferences on a common topic prior to a special issue did not appear to impact the type of papers submitted to or published in the special issue. We discuss the role of special issues and preconferences in knowledge development in organization science.</p>
            <p>Twenty-five years of economic reform has propelled China to the center of the world's economic stage. Based on current trends, in the foreseeable future China is likely to become the largest economy in the world. China's dramatic growth may be envied by other developing economies, but for management scholars it presents an exciting intellectual puzzle. In this paper we describe the empirical context of China today, review contemporary research on Chinese management and organizations, and describe the nine papers in this special issue of Organization Science. The papers provide a close examination of how massive corporate transformation in China has influenced interfirm relationships, affected opportunity structures and social processes, and modified individual behaviors within firms. We identify the many paradoxes in this intellectual terrain and present a guide to the challenging research agenda ahead. We recommend that scholars of organizations think deeply about China as a context and consider China as an empirical setting where the boundaries of existing knowledge on organizations can be extended.</p>
            <p>During economic transition, firms must dramatically reduce their financial dependence on the state and begin to borrow from nonstate capital sources. This paper draws on institutional and resource dependence theories to examine this fundamental transformation of firm capital structure during China's transition. I propose that managers borrowed from external sources even when internal funds were available because retained earnings were considered state assets. Firms used retained earnings to signal financial health but borrowed externally to reduce dependence on the state. Uncertainty during transformation produced interfirm imitation of borrowing strategies, particularly imitation of local and high status others. I argue that the dynamics of market development shaped firm borrowing strategies and that these strategies are best viewed as trajectories over time. Analysis of survey data on the 1980-1989 capital structure of formerly state-owned firms provides support for these arguments and highlights the importance of institutional context in understanding corporate borrowing and strategic decision making.</p>
            <p>This article examines the effect of entrepreneurs' social capital on investment decisions of venture capitalists. The empirical data is composed of 158 venture capital decisions in the People's Republic of China. We found that entrepreneurs' social capital has significant effects on investment selection decisions of venture capitalists in interaction with growth potential and technology/products of the venture. We also found that strong ties between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have significant direct effects on investment process decisions such as contractual covenants, investment delivery, and venture valuation.</p>
            <p>China and Russia represent major economies in transition from command economies, yet their paths to the market have differed greatly. Their divergent approaches have helped create distinct institutional environments. This study focuses on a particularly important strategic decision firms face-alliance partner selection. The study's results suggest that China's more stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Chinese firms take a longer-term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner's intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities. In contrast, the less stable Russian institutional environment has influenced Russian managers to focus more on the short term, selecting partners that provide access to financial capital and complementary capabilities so as to enhance their firms' ability to weather that nation's turbulent environment. This study contributes to knowledge about the influence of the institutional environment on alliance partner selection decisions for firms domiciled in transition (and emerging) economies.</p>
            <p>Since the 1980s, the People's Republic of China has embarked on a path of economic transformation that has led to profound changes in organizations. Based on work histories of a sample of urban residents drawn from 14 Chinese cities in six provinces, we assess the extent and direction of organizational transformation by analyzing changes in promotion patterns between the prereform era (1949-1979) and the reform era (1980-1994). We begin with Walder's dual-path model and examine distinctive mechanisms for promotion along two institutionalized-administrative and professional-career lines. We enrich Walder's model by considering the impact of macropolitical processes on career dynamics and the effect of emerging market mechanisms on different organizational sectors. Our findings show that there have been both continuity and significant changes in the criteria and opportunities of promotion in Chinese organizations across the two periods. In the reform era, more educated managers who were recently recruited into the organizations had the highest probability of being promoted. There were also significant variations in promotion patterns across career lines and organizational sectors, reflecting the impacts of both institutional persistence and emerging market forces.</p>
            <p>Taking a procedural justice perspective, we examined the effect of guanxi practices in human resources management (i.e., making human resources management decisions on the basis of personal relationships) on employees' trust in management in Chinese organizations. Two studies were conducted. In the first, a survey study, we found a negative effect of guanxi practices on trust in management, which was mediated by perceived procedural justice. In the second, an experimental study, we found that the negative effect of guanxi practices varied as a function of guanxi bases: favoring a nephew or a hometown fellow lowered trust, but favoring a college schoolmate or a close friend did not. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>This study investigated the generation cohort value orientations of 774 Chinese and 784 U.S. managers and professionals. The three Chinese generations (Consolidation, Cultural Revolution, Social Reform) since the establishment of Communist China were significantly more open to change and self-enhancement but less conservative and self-transcendent than the Republican Era generation. The value orientations of U.S. generations (Generation X, Baby Boomer, Silent generation) followed an age-related pattern with the exception of self-transcendence values. The least similar value orientations were between Chinese and U.S. generations that had grown up during Communist China's closed-door policy. The more entrepreneurial value orientations of the most recent Chinese generations appear to be compatible with organizational changes currently under way in China's state-owned sector.</p>
            <p>The ownership restructuring of Chinese state-owned enterprises, launched in 1992, has been one of the most radical and far-reaching market-oriented reforms in the Chinese economy. We studied the effects of ownership reform and individuals' collectivist values on rewards-allocation preferences of employees in Chinese state-owned enterprises, and how these relationships were mediated by employees' productivity goal orientation. We predicted the effects of ownership reform and collectivism on rewards-allocation preferences based on the model of allocation goal priority and the conceptual distinctions of vertical and horizontal collectivism. With data from four pairs of public state-owned enterprises (i.e., listed on the stock market) versus pure state-owned enterprises, we found the following results. First, employees of enterprises that had experienced a greater degree of ownership reform expressed stronger preferences for differential allocation rules (e.g., job position and performance) but weaker preferences for equalitarian allocation rules (e.g., group and individual equality). Second, vertical collectivism was positively related to preferences for differential allocation rules, but horizontal collectivism was positively related to preferences for equalitarian allocation rules. Third, the effects of both ownership reform and vertical collectivism on differential allocation preferences were mediated by productivity goal orientation. Research and practical implications for ownership reform and vertical-horizontal collectivism are discussed.</p>
            <p>This study investigates the contribution of organizational support and personal relations in accounting for Chinese workers' affective commitment to the organization for which they work and their organizational citizenship behavior. In a sample of 605 matched cases of employees and their immediate supervisors from a large, reformed state-owned firm, organizational support was found to relate to affective commitment more strongly than to organizational citizenship behavior. Personal relations, however, were found to relate similarly to affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. Moderator effects are evident with the less-traditional Chinese employees manifesting greater citizenship behavior than do more-traditional Chinese, in response to a high-quality relationship with their supervisor. More-traditional Chinese contribute citizenship behavior that is moderately high, regardless of the quality of their relationship with their supervisor. These findings suggest a need to revise certain assumptions regarding the nature of the employee-employer exchange relationship in China and in similar transitional societies.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Western scholars have increasingly emphasized the importance of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)-employees' behavior and actions that are not specifically designated in their formal job duties. Almost the entire body of empirical research on OCB is based on studies conducted in the United States, using U.S. employee populations as samples. Taking an inductive approach, we examined forms of OCB in the People's Republic of China (China). From a diverse sample of 158 employees and managers in 72 state-owned, collective, town and village, foreign-invested, and private enterprises in China, we collected 726 OCB incidents or items that were commonly observed in the workplace. We then subjected these to a content analysis to identify major forms of OCB. Results of our analysis revealed 10 dimensions of OCB, with at least one dimension not evident at all in the Western literature, and four that do not figure importantly in established OCB measures. The type of organizations influenced the reporting of several forms of OCB. Results suggested that Chinese formulation of OCB differs from that in the West, and is embedded in its unique social and cultural context. We discuss these results in terms of their implications for future research in OCB.</p>
            <p>In this study, we address the topic of interorganizational network change by exploring factors that affect the choice of alliance and interlock partners. While many studies have been devoted to investigating various factors driving network partner choice, there is also an interesting and unexplored tension in this body of work. On the one hand, much work emphasizes change in social structure-showing that firms expand networks by forming new relationships with new partners. At the same time, other scholars emphasize stability of social structure-showing that firms tend to choose past exchange partners. We seek to reconcile this tension by proposing that firms form new relationships with new partners as a form of exploration, and form additional relationships with existing partners as a form of exploitation (March 1991). Further, whether exploration or exploitation is chosen depends on the type of uncertainty that firms are facing: whether it is firm-specific or market-level uncertainty. We test our hypotheses using data on both interlock and alliance networks for the 300 largest U.S. firms during the 1988-1993 period. The results provide some evidence that whether networks are stable or changing depends on the type of uncertainty experienced by firms.</p>
            <p>This study moves beyond the dominant "strategic persistence" view of momentum toward one focused on the energy associated with pursuit of a change goal. A conceptual distinction is made between inertia, the momentum associated with strategic persistence, and the momentum of strategic change. Building on this distinction, a theoretical framework is developed that examines the influence of various change-related events and social processes on momentum during the early stages of organizational change. The research reported in this manuscript was conducted over a 10-month period in an organization attempting to change its culture, employing both qualitative and longitudinal quantitative methods. This study provides validity evidence for the proposed momentum construct and identifies various factors that predict momentum. Results support a spiraling relationship between momentum and goal attainment, such that momentum predicts progress toward goal attainment, which then influences subsequent momentum. Practical implications and directions for future research are provided based on these findings.</p>
            <p>In this paper I argue that understanding resources through a social practice perspective enables us to understand more about the role of resources in change. In particular, social practice theory enables us to view resources in context as mutable sources of energy rather than as stable things that are independent of context, and to analyze the reciprocal relationship between actions and resources as they change. This approach to understanding resources requires an elaboration on current social practice theory and provides a new way to understand organizational change. This perspective is used to show how resources transform in unexpected ways as a result of change in organizational routines and how this transformation of resources makes resistance to change difficult to predict.</p>
            <p>This paper examines how the inconsistency of organizational conditions affects people's willingness to engage in experimentation, a behavior integral to innovation. Because failures are inevitable in the experimentation process, we argue that conditions giving rise to psychological safety reduce fear of failure and promote experimentation. Based on this reasoning, we suggest that inconsistent organizational conditions-when some support experimentation and others do not-inhibit experimentation behaviors. An exploratory study in the field, followed by a laboratory experiment, found that individuals under high evaluative pressure were less likely to experiment when normative values and instrumental rewards were inconsistent in supporting experimentation. In contrast, individuals under low evaluative pressure responded to inconsistent conditions with increased experimentation. Our results suggest that evaluative pressure fundamentally alters an individual's experience of and response to uncertainty and that understanding experimentation behavior requires examining effects of multiple organizational conditions in combination.</p>
            <p>This article reviews theories of organizational communication with a special emphasis on theories that have been used to explain computer-mediated communication phenomena. Among the theories reviewed, two-social presence and media richness-are identified as problematic and as posing obstacles to future theoretical development. While shortcomings of these theories have been identified in the past, some of these theories' predictions have been supported by empirical evidence. It is argued that this theoretical dilemma can be resolved based upon principles derived from a modem version of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and the application of those principles to the understanding of human evolution. A new theoretical model called the psychobiological model is developed, which predicts variations in cognitive effort in computer-mediated collaborative tasks. The model proposes that there is a negative causal link between the "naturalness" of a computer-mediated communication medium, which is the similarity of the medium to the face-to-face medium, and the cognitive effort required from an individual using the medium for knowledge transfer. The model also states that this link is counterbalanced by what are referred to as "schema alignment" and "cognitive adaptation." The schema alignment construct refers to the similarity between the mental schemas of an individual and those of other participant(s). The cognitive adaptation construct refers to an individual's level of schema development associated with the use of a particular medium. Finally, the model states that the degree to which the medium supports an individual's ability to convey and listen to speech is particularly significant in defining its naturalness, more so than the medium's degree of support for the use of facial expressions and body language. An example is offered of how the psychobiological model can be tested in the context provided by the customer support area of an online broker.</p>
            <p>Corporate scandals and abuses of various kinds grab the headlines. Reform initiatives quickly follow outrage. The goal is to constrain our firms' ability to destroy value and lives, while at the same time enabling them to produce and deliver high-quality and profitable goods and services in a very competitive global marketplace. Less obvious but no less important, civil society is increasingly asking corporations to invest directly in social life. Regardless of their productive capabilities, firms can field requests to invest in education, health care, infrastructure, and the like. Sometimes the two ambitions seem to be quite compatible, while at other times they seem to be at odds. Leading a business that is at once socially responsive and economically competitive is a daunting managerial challenge. The theoretical challenge posed by these sometimes competing and sometimes complementary demands is no less daunting. Since the rise of the first corporations two thousand years ago, we have been trying to develop a theory of the firm that explains and guides firm behavior. Sundaram and Inkpen enter this complex and charged world to make a case for a theory of the firm grounded in the pursuit of shareholder wealth. Freeman, Wicks, and Parmar will not let their view go unchallenged. They offer a spirited reply. The exchange embodies everything our Crossroads section can be. We are proud to provide a home for this very thoughtful exchange. This is arguably the most important theoretical and practical issue confronting us today. While we gave Sundaram and Inkpen the last word, we know that the debate is far from over. Indeed, we invite others to think hard about these issues and develop their own point of view. The stakes are enormous.</p>
            <p>The stock market convulsions and corporate scandals of 2001 and 2002 have reignited debate on the purposes of the corporation and, in particular, the goal of shareholder value maximization. We revisit the debate, re-examine the traditional rationales, and develop a set of new arguments for why the preferred objective function for the corporation must unambiguously continue to be the one that says "maximize shareholder value." We trace the origins of the debates from the late nineteenth century, their implications for accepted law and practice of corporate governance in the United States, and their reflection in shareholder versus stakeholder views in the organization studies literature and contractarian versus communitarian views in the legal literature. We address in detail possible critiques of the shareholder value maximization view. Although we recognize certain boundary constraints to our arguments, we conclude that the issues raised by such critiques and constraints are not unique to the shareholder value maximization view, but will exist even if the firm is managed on behalf of nonshareowning stakeholders.</p>
            <p>Stakeholder theory begins with the assumption that values are necessarily and explicitly a part of doing business. It asks managers to articulate the shared sense of the value they create, and what brings its core stakeholders together. It also pushes managers to be clear about how they want to do business, specifically what kinds of relationships they want and need to create with their stakeholders to deliver on their purpose. This paper offers a response to Sundaram and Inkpen's article "The Corporate Objective Revisited" by clarifying misconceptions about stakeholder theory and concluding that truth and freedom are best served by seeing business and ethics as connected.</p>
            <p>Freeman et al. (2004) offer a spirited rebuttal to our paper "The Corporate Objective Revisited" from the perspective of stakeholder theory. However, they fall short in making a case against the logic of shareholder value maximization. The authors confound issues of "value" and "values," ignore the rich history of scholarship on related questions, and perhaps misinterpret some of our core arguments. Most importantly, proponents of stakeholder views such as Freeman et al. appear to be unable to go beyond critiques of the shareholder view by failing to offer an empirically supportable alternative theory.</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the role of emotion in organizational decision making. Grounding our research in the decision process literature, we introduce the concept of "toxic decision processes": organizational decision processes that generate widespread negative emotion in an organization through the recursive interplay of members' actions and negative emotions. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative analysis of six toxic decision processes to develop a model that describes the three phases-inertia, detonation, and containment-through which these processes unfold. Each phase is characterized by distinctive sets of interactions among decision makers and other organizational members, and by emotions such as anxiety, fear, shame, anger, and embarrassment, that shape and are shaped by these interactions. We show that toxic decision processes are triggered by issues that are sensitive, ambiguous, and nonurgent and identify several mechanisms that connect actors' emotions and actions, over time creating a toxic decision process that leads to the cumulative buildup and diffusion of toxicity. These mechanisms include the construction of a "danger zone" around the issue that is avoided by all parties, the spread of negative emotion through processes of empathetic transmission and emotional contagion, and the suppression of widespread negative emotion that leads to the development of a volatile emotional context for future decision making. This study has important implications for the decision process literature, revealing how the different lenses through which decision making is usually viewed are connected by the emotionality that runs through each of them.</p>
            <p>Organizational forms involving more detailed contracts than are found in traditional spot market exchanges appear to be increasingly prevalent. There has been relatively little analysis, however, of the extent to which firms learn how to use contracts to manage their interfirm relationships over time. In this paper, we conduct a detailed case study of a time series of 11 contracts concluded during 1989-1997 between the same two partners, both of whom participate in the personal computer industry, to explore whether and how firms learn to contract. We find many changes to the structure of the contracts that cannot be fully explained by changes in the assets at risk in the relationship, and evidence that these changes are largely the result of processes in which the firms were learning how to work together, including learning how to contract with each other. The nature of this learning appears to have been quite incremental and local, that is, not very far sighted. We suggest how and when contracts might serve as repositories for knowledge about how to govern collaborations, and suggest some boundary conditions for this phenomenon. Our findings also provide implications for the debate about whether contracts have a positive or negative effect on interorganizational trust. We conclude with suggestions for future research.</p>
            <p>Contemporary workplaces solicit heightened effort and initiative from employees through teams and related forms of participation. Trustworthy behavior on the part of organizations is an important precondition for heightened employee effort and initiative. The current article develops a model of organizational trustworthiness based on: (1) employment practices and (2) managerial competence. Testing such models has been difficult in the past because of the difficulty of gathering data on relevant management and employee behaviors across a broad population of organizations. The current article uses data derived from a content analysis of the population of organizational ethnographies (N = 204) to address this problem. The analysis verifies the existence of employment practices and management competence as separate factors. The effects of these factors on worker citizenship, employee-management conflict, and coworker relations are also evaluated. Supportive employment practices are an important precondition for worker citizenship. Management competence, however, is even more consequential for worker citizenship and for other workplace relations as well. The findings highlight the importance of cross-methods comparisons for advancing organizational theory.</p>
            <p>Research on information processing, managerial cognition, and social networks demonstrates that people rely on other people for information. However, this work has not specified how seeking information from others results in actionable knowledge-knowledge directed at making progress on relatively short-term projects. This research employs both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how personal sources of information contribute to actionable knowledge. Our qualitative study found that people cultivate different kinds of information relationships that are the source of 5 components of actionable knowledge: (1) solutions (both know-what and know-how), (2) referrals (pointers to other people or databases), (3) problem reformulation, (4) validation, and (5) legitimation. Our quantitative study revealed that, while source expertise predicted receipt of these components of actionable knowledge, so too did expertise of the seeker and features of the relationship between the seeker and source. We draw implications from these findings for the study of social capital and organizational learning.</p>
            <p>This paper explores the links that the allocation of decision rights on the shop floor maintains with labor transaction attributes and several structural traits of the firm. The approach is based on the transaction cost apparatus and harnesses the theoretical and empirical background provided by organization theory. Data are presented from a wide field survey in the Spanish food and electronics industries (Standard Industry Classification (SIC) 20 and 36). Evidence not only verifies the influence of firm size, property, age, and unionism, but also shows that the allocation of decision rights is related to a particular mix of labor transaction traits. Specifically, one of the most important results is that employer opportunism offers greater explanatory power than employee opportunism.</p>
            <p>While exploration and exploitation represent two fundamentally different approaches to organizational learning, recent literature has increasingly indicated the need for firms to achieve a balance between the two. This balanced view is embedded in the concept of ambidextrous organizations. However, there is little direct evidence of the positive effect of ambidexterity on firm performance. This paper seeks to test the ambidexterity hypothesis by examining how exploration and exploitation can jointly influence firm performance in the context of firms' approach to technological innovation. Based on a sample of 206 manufacturing firms, we find evidence consistent with the ambidexterity hypothesis by showing that (1) the interaction between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is positively related to sales growth rate, and (2) the relative imbalance between explorative and exploitative innovation strategies is negatively related to sales growth rate.</p>
            <p>We draw on complexity theory to explain the emergence of a new organizational collective, and we provide a much-needed empirical test of the theory at the collective level of analysis. Taking a case study approach, we use four dynamics of emergence posited by complexity theory's dissipative structures model-fluctuation, positive feedback, stabilization, and recombination-to explain how a collective of live musical performance theaters in Branson, Missouri, came into being and periodically transformed itself over a 100-year period. Our findings suggest a strong match between the theoretical perspective employed and the empirical processes uncovered, empirically validating the model at the collective level. The study demonstrates the value of conceptualizing evolution in terms of emergence, highlighting distinctions between the nascent complexity approach to evolution and the neo-Darwinian evolutionary approach that has dominated the theoretical conversation in organization science for the past generation. Our findings complement the insights of the dominant theoretical perspectives in organization theory, providing a more comprehensive understanding of organizational evolution by directly addressing the heretofore intractable phenomenon of emergence.</p>
            <p>The focus of this article is the patterns of interaction that arise within work groups, and how organizational and institutional factors play a role in shaping these patterns. Based on an ethnographic study of groups across three national contexts, we describe the variation in patterns of interaction that we observed. We further suggest how different patterns of interaction form mutually reinforcing systems with aspects of the organizational context. In addition, we suggest how these mutually reinforcing systems are perpetuated by aspects of the broader institutional context. Our findings point toward a nested theory of structuration, expanding structuration theory to multiple levels simultaneously. In turn our findings have theoretical and practical implications for better understanding and managing interaction patterns among group members.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the joint impact of firm- and country-level factors on the international plant location decisions of semiconductor firms from 1994-2002. We find that these factors interact to influence the location decisions of firms investing abroad in a given host country. Firms with more advanced technological capabilities are more likely to make investments in countries with greater technological sophistication but not in politically hazardous countries where they face greater expropriation hazards. Firms with less-advanced technology are more willing to accept a trade-off between country-level political hazards and technological sophistication. Firms also trade off own- versus other-firm experience as sources of critical knowledge regarding the foreign investment environment.</p>
            <p>The paper examines managing knowledge across boundaries in settings where innovation is desired. Innovation is a useful context because it allows us to explore the negative consequences of the path-dependent nature of knowledge. A framework is developed that describes three progressively complex boundaries-syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic-and three progressively complex processes-transfer, translation, and transformation. The framework is used to specify the practical and political mismatches that occur when innovation is desired and how this relates to the common knowledge that actors use to share and assess each other's domain-specific knowledge. The development and use of a collaborative engineering tool in the early stages of a vehicle's development is presented to illustrate the conceptual and prescriptive value of the framework. The implication of this framework on key topics in the organization theory and strategy literatures is then discussed.</p>
            <p>This research elaborated and empirically tested the individual action component of the collective action model as applied to individual contributions to organizational information commons. The model extended prior theory and research by making six elaborations on the classic collective action model based on unique characteristics of information goods compared to material collective goods. The structural equation model was tested via LISREL analyses of data provided by 781 respondents in three high-tech firms who had access to corporate intranets as shared information goods. The results were highly similar across organizations and indicated that (a) level of production, information retrieval, and cost predicted the perceived value of information, (b) information value and cost predicted gain, and (c) information retrieval and gain predicted the level of individual contributions to the commons.</p>
            <p>This article examines the evolution of trust, control, and learning in a joint venture relationship. Using a coevolutionary approach, we develop a framework that shows how initial joint venture conditions give way to evolved conditions as joint venture partners develop an understanding of each other and adjust the collaborative process. We explore the relationship between trust and control in joint ventures and identify how these two critical concepts impact joint venture processes. We argue that trust, along with partner collaborative objectives, creates the initial climate that shapes partner interactions. In turn, these interactions lead to subsequent decisions about the nature of controls. We then examine linkages between alliance learning and the trust and control concepts, and argue that learning processes are central to evolving joint venture dynamics. Once the joint venture is formed, and if the initial conditions support continued collaboration, then learning processes will be central to evolving alliance dynamics. As initial conditions give way to evolved conditions, learning and trust will coevolve and impact decisions about control. Propositions linking the concepts are provided as guides for future empirical research.</p>
            <p>The recognition that better use of existing internal knowledge could enhance survival chances of organizations has spawned substantial interest in the transferability of routinized, experiential learning to additional settings within the organization. Previous research has established that trustworthiness of the source enhances such knowledge transfer. More recent work, however, suggests that this may not always be the case. Yet, little systematic attention has been paid to moderating conditions. The major purpose of this paper is to identify a moderator, causal ambiguity, which delineates the conditions as to when and how a recipient's perception of the trustworthiness of a source affects the effectiveness of the transfer of organizational practices.</p>
            <p>In this paper we develop a knowledge-based theory of the firm. While existing knowledge-based theory focuses on the efficiency of hierarchy in economizing on knowledge exchange, we develop a theory of the firm that focuses on the efficiency of alternative organizational forms in generating knowledge or capability. Our theory begins with the problem as the basic unit of analysis, arguing that a problem's complexity influences the optimal method of solution search and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing.</p>
            <p>Transactive memory is the shared division of cognitive labor with respect to the encoding, storage, retrieval, and communication of information from different knowledge domains, which often develops in groups and can lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness. Although discussions of transactive memory theory suggest that components of the theory are dynamic, research tends to treat transactive memory as evolving linearly, using static measures rather than assessing development over time. In response, we offer a model emphasizing both linear and cyclical aspects of transactive memory development in work groups, and we propose that task is a major influence on developmental processes. We introduce task representation and the task-expertise-person (TEP) unit as basic constructs involved in transactive memory development, and we provide a dynamic model of how TEP units are constructed, evaluated, and utilized. Regarding observable changes over time, we propose that transactive memory systems can vary in terms of accuracy (the degree to which group members' perceptions about others' task-related expertise are accurate), sharedness (the degree to which members have a shared representation of the transactive memory system), and validation (the degree to which group members participate in the transactive memory system). Convergence is the optimal state of transactive memory systems and reflects high levels of accuracy, sharedness, and validation.</p>
            <p>There is increasing recognition that group members learn not only within the group (i.e., local learning), but also externally (i.e., distal learning), and these two group learning processes may facilitate group performance in different ways. Yet, despite this recognition, there is much that is not understood about whether they complement or inhibit each other in affecting group performance, and whether group social and task conditions that foster one type of learning do so at the expense of the other. The findings from this field study of teams from four firms show that (1) local learning and distal learning are positively related to group efficiency and group innovativeness, respectively; (2) distal learning negatively interacts with local learning to impede group efficiency; and (3) high levels of group cohesion promote distal learning but diminish local learning. Overall, these findings suggest that there are not only performance trade-offs to engaging in either only local or distal learning, but also performance disadvantages to engaging in both types of group learning because distal learning impedes local learning from achieving a high level of group efficiency. In addition, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that tensions can arise from simultaneously managing both types of group learning because a high level of group cohesion increases distal learning but decreases local learning.</p>
            <p>The theory and research on chief executive officer (CEO) compensation tends to be dominated by assumptions and values reflective of those dominant in the national culture of the United States, where most of this work is done. This suggests that an underlying theme focuses on how CEO compensation is related to instrumental choices made in a competitive, capitalist culture. This study seeks to expand the understanding of CEO compensation by examining it in the context of other cultures, based on the premise that national culture plays a significant part in the nature of compensation strategies. We relate cultural dimensions (uncertainty avoidance, power distance, individualism, and masculinity-femininity) developed by Hofstede (Hofstede 1980a, 2001) to several dimensions of CEO compensation. These dimensions are total CEO pay, the proportion of variable pay to total compensation, and the ratio of CEO pay to the lowest level employees. The main findings of our paper are (1) all of the different dimensions of CEO pay were related to power distance, leading us to infer that CEO pay in a culture is most reflective of the strength of the power structure in a society, and (2) total compensation and the ratio of variable pay to total pay are related to individualism. We conclude that cultural dimensions can contribute to understanding cross-national CEO compensation. The implication of this conclusion is that there are different ways that CEO compensation fits into the cognitive schema of various cultures and, furthermore, that these cognitive schema vary across societies that affect the nature of the "cultural matrix into which [money] is incorporated" (Bloch and Parry 1989, p. 1). Moreover, our results imply that particular forms of CEO compensation do not mean the same thing in different cultures, but rather carry different symbolic connotations depending on the values dominant in a society. Thus, not only does the compensation structure of a firm within a culture have a symbolic meaning within organizations (e.g., Trice and Beyer 1993), but it can also be seen as an expression of deeper social values (Hofstede et al. 1990) that may differ across countries.</p>
            <p>This paper documents emotion as integral to stakeholders' sense making of a key organizational artifact, demonstrating that emotion toward artifacts blends into emotion toward the organization. Multiple stakeholders were interviewed about an artifact of a large public transportation organization. Sense making of the artifact is shown to involve emotion in interpretations that consider three dimensions of the artifact-instrumentality, aesthetics, and symbolism. Instrumentality relates to the tasks the artifact helps accomplish, aesthetics is the sensory reaction to the artifact, and symbolism regards associations the artifact elicits. The analysis demonstrates that sense making of these three dimensions includes unsolicited emotion both toward the artifact and toward the organization. Emotion that surfaces in sense making of organizational artifacts is, thus, suggested to be what links interpretation of artifacts and attitudes toward organizations. This paper lays foundations for a theory of organizational artifacts that can guide both thoughtful research and effective management of artifacts in organizations.</p>
            <p>Firms often delegate elements of strategic decisions to outside experts who promise objective assessments, which are especially valuable in unstable environments. However experts themselves may be prone to skewed decision making as the stability of their own industry environment changes and as their positioning within the industry shifts. We examine this possibility in the context of expert credit-rating agencies ("agencies") and their risk ratings of emerging-market sovereign borrowers ("ratings") published from 1987 to 1998, a period that includes both industry stability (1987-1996) and industry turbulence set off by financial crises in several emerging-market countries (1997-1998). After controlling for macroeconomic and related objective risk factors linked to the sovereigns themselves, we find several points: (1) agency ratings during crisis-induced industry turbulence are negatively skewed, indicating undue pessimism among these experts, in line with decision-making perspectives predicting negative reaction by experts in an effort to retain legitimacy with salient stakeholders, in this case, investors and public regulators; (2) this negative shift is greater for incumbent firms and regionally focused firms, possibly because of the loss of previous informational advantages; and (3) this negative shift during crisis-induced turbulence is greater as industry rivalry among these experts increases in particular market segments, possibly indicating the development of competitive bandwagons among experts. Together, our results suggest that objective assessments by expert organizations are vulnerable to substantial distortion from the confluent effects of industry instability and expert positioning within the industry, particularly positioning affecting rivalry among experts. Ironically, experts may be most likely to mislead clients in unstable industry environments when experts command greater attention and should show greater fidelity to disinterested objectivity.</p>
            <p>Unanimity rule is an important benchmark for evaluating outcomes of decisions in the social sciences. However, organizational researchers tend to ignore unanimous decision making, for example, because unanimity may be difficult to realize in large groups and may suffer from individual participants blocking decisions. This paper reconsiders unanimity rule in view of the development of circular systems for organizing decision making. It focuses on developing a theory of decision making under unanimity rule. The author uses a system dynamics model to explore the conditions under which unanimity rule supports the organization's ability to make decisions. Simulation experiments suggest that the dynamics and outcomes of unanimous decision making under and exceeding a critical threshold level of decision pressure are fundamentally different. Under this critical threshold, the decision-making system is capable of recovering from severe shocks to the system. If decision pressure is close to its threshold, a relatively small change can cause the decision process to collapse. In this respect, large groups operating under unanimity rule are less sustainable because they are more likely to exceed their critical threshold than small groups. Decomposing the decision-making system in small units, embedded in a hierarchical structure, therefore appears to be a necessary condition for sustainable performance in large organizations applying unanimity rule.</p>
            <p>In this article, we begin to integrate two fields that have, until now, remained largely independent of one another: organizational justice and transaction-cost economics. Transaction costs consist of search, bargaining, monitoring, enforcement, and other costs not directly related to the production of goods or services. Usually such costs are attributed to difficulties in measurement (the metering problem) or difficulties in redeploying assets to alternative uses (asset specificity). These variables are thought to be objective features of economic transactions. Rarely are the social-psychological dimensions of these objective features taken into account. Although economic transactions are fundamentally human activities, human behavior in the economics literature is usually reduced to such simplifying assumptions as shirking and bounded rationality. In this article, we develop a model of transaction costs based on a more complete description of human psychology as it operates in exchange relationships. We argue that transaction costs are often due to the difficulty of evaluating the fairness of a specific exchange of goods and services. Besides asset specificity and the metering problem, which are treated in the transaction-cost economics literature, the organizational justice literature is especially relevant. Beginning with the work of Ouchi (1980), the paper examines some of the ways that the organizational justice literature complements transaction-cost economics. Because mechanisms that order economic transactions are essentially conflict-resolution structures, we develop a model of economic organization in which transaction costs are related to the perception of fairness in economic exchange. In the literature, governance mechanisms are selected so as to minimize transaction costs. Based on the organizational justice framework, we suggest that the transaction-cost calculus is affected by the perception of fairness in the exchange. In addition, the relationship between the governance mechanism and the perception of fairness is moderated by the elements of interactional justice that characterize the exchange.</p>
            <p>This study of the emergence of the film industry in the U.S. between 1893 and 1920 contributes to the growing literature linking legal environments and population dynamics. This was an era characterized by a shift to active anti-trust policy, which manifested itself in legal action to disband a trust that had dominated the industry, the Motion Pictures Patents Corporation (MPPC). We use archival data to show that mortality was reduced by trust membership and increased with the market share of the trust members. The effects of litigation are varied, with litigation filed by trust members enhancing mortality and litigation filed against trust members decreasing mortality. Analysis of coded headlines from media reports on the emerging industry shows that a shift in the view of the trust in the normative environment toward a more negative view was also associated with decreased mortality. Results also show that learning and the compensatory fitness enjoyed before anti-trust law was enforced prevented the MPPC members from recognizing changes in the marketplace; as a result, they were less likely to move from making short films to making increasingly popular feature-length films.</p>
            <p>This paper describes the role of rhetoric in legitimating profound institutional change. In 1997, a Big Five accounting firm purchased a law firm, triggering a juris-dictional struggle within accounting and law over a new organizational form, multidisciplinary partnerships. We analyze the discursive struggle that ensued between proponents and opponents of the new organizational form. We observe that such rhetorical strategies contain two elements. First are institutional vocabularies, or the use of identifying words and referential texts to expose contradictory institutional logics embedded in historical understandings of professionalism, one based on a trustee model and the other based on a model of expertise. A second element of rhetorical strategies is theorizations of change by which actors contest a proposed innovation against broad templates or scenarios of change. We identify five such theorizations of change (teleological, historical, cosmological, ontological, and value-based) and describe their characteristics.</p>

            <p>We examine the organizational identification of contract workers who are associated with two organizations, their primary employer and their client. We conducted a study of contract workers in the information technology industry to address three questions: (1) What are the antecedents of contract workers' identification with the work organizations with which they are associated? (2) Do these antecedents differentially predict identification with each of the target organizations? and (3) What is the relationship between contract workers' identification with their employing organization and their identification with their client organization? Results indicate that contract workers identify with both the employing and client organizations based on perceived characteristics of the organization as well as social relations within the organization. Perceived characteristics of the organization are more closely related with identification with the employer, and social relations variables are more closely related with identification with the client. Contract workers are more likely to identify with both their client and their employing organization when the two are perceived to be similar on key attributes.</p>
            <p>This study examines the microprocesses in the social networks of those involved in organizational innovation and their strategic behavioral orientation toward connecting people in their social network by either introducing disconnected individuals or facilitating new coordination between connected individuals. This tertius iungens (or "third who joins") strategic orientation, contrasts with the tertius gaudens orientation emphasized in structural holes theory, which concerns the advantage of a broker who can play people off against one another for his or her own benefit. Results of a multimethod study of networks and innovation in an engineering division of an automotive manufacturer show that a tertius iungens orientation, dense social networks, and diverse social knowledge predict involvement in innovation. Implications of the study for innovation and social networks, as well as for social skill and agency within firms are presented.</p>
            <p>Despite ubiquitous references to Pfeffer and Salancik's classic volume, The External Control of Organizations, resource dependence theory is more of an appealing metaphor than a foundation for testable empirical research. We argue that several ambiguities in the resource dependence model account in part for this and propose a reformulation of resource dependence theory that addresses these ambiguities, yields novel predictions and findings, and reconciles them with seemingly contradictory empirical evidence from past studies. We identify two distinct theoretical dimensions of resource dependence, power imbalance and mutual dependence, which in the original theory were combined in the construct of interdependence and yet have opposite effects on an organization's ability to reduce dependencies by absorbing sources of external constraint. Results from a study of interindustry mergers and acquisitions among U.S. public companies in the period 1985-2000 indicate that, while mutual dependence is a key driver of mergers and acquisitions, power imbalance acts as an obstacle to their formation. We conclude that our reformulation of the resource dependence model contributes to realizing the potential of resource dependency as a powerful explanation of interorganizational action.</p>

            <p>Building on sociological research on institutions and organizations and psychological research on risk and decision making, we propose that the development of institutions that reduce the risks of entering new sectors has a stronger effect on the founding rates of firms using novel technologies than on firms using established technologies. In an analysis of the independent-power sector of the electricity industry from 1980 to 1992, we found that the development of regulative and cognitive institutions legitimated the entire sector and provided incentives for all sector entrants; thus, foundings of all kinds of firms multiplied rapidly but had a stronger impact on those using risky novel technologies. In contrast, the central normative institutions that developed in this sector, state-level trade associations, provided greater support for particular forms (those using established technologies) and thus increased foundings of those favored forms more than foundings of less favored forms (those using novel technologies). Our study demonstrates how institutional forces can alter the mix of organizations entering a new industry and thus contribute to diversity, as well as similarity, among organizations.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the earliest boundary work for a female-dominated occupation that portrayed men rather than women as the appropriate practitioners. According to the concept of gender primacy, men would not enter a female-dominated occupation in large numbers because it is associated with gender essentialism. Hospital administration is one of the rare female occupations that did masculinize. Our analysis of archival texts on hospital administration in the early 1900s describes that in establishing a jurisdiction, body of knowledge, and educational requirements, the male-dominated professional association created a male sex boundary. Extracting and elaborating functions consistent with gender primacy and sloughing off functions associated with gender essentialism reframed the occupation as male. Rhetorical use of gender created a male image of the generic practitioner and the occupation, while an internal boundary segregated women within the occupation. The study points to differences in how occupations feminize and masculinize and suggests the latter does not occur solely in response to societal factors, as has been assumed, but can originate within the occupation.</p>

            <p>This study examines how a social psychological bias referred to as pluralistic ignorance may occur in corporate boards and how this bias could contribute to strategic persistence in response to relatively low firm performance. Our theory suggests that under conditions of low performance, there may be a systematic tendency for outside directors to underestimate the extent to which fellow directors share their concerns about the viability of the firm's corporate strategy. This reduces the propensity for individual directors to express their concerns about the current corporate strategy in board meetings, decreasing the likelihood that boards will initiate strategic change in response to low firm performance. We also posit factors that may moderate the extent to which pluralistic ignorance occurs on boards. We suggest that demographic homogeneity among outside directors (with respect to gender, functional background, education, and industry of employment) and the density of friendship ties among them will significantly moderate the occurrence of pluralistic ignorance on boards. We test our hypotheses with original survey data from a large sample of outside directors at medium-sized U.S. companies and find support for our theory. We discuss contributions of our theory and findings to the literatures on corporate governance, strategic persistence and change, and group decision-making processes in organizations.</p>
            <p>A field study of 29 resource-constrained firms that varied dramatically in their responses to similar objective environments is used to examine the process by which entrepreneurs in resource-poor environments were able to render unique services by recombining elements at hand for new purposes that challenged institutional definitions and limits. We found that L√©vi-Strauss's concept of bricolage-making do with what is at hand-explained many of the behaviors we observed in small firms that were able to create something from nothing by exploiting physical, social, or institutional inputs that other firms rejected or ignored. We demonstrate the socially constructed nature of resource environments and the role of bricolage in this construction. Using our field data and the existing literature on bricolage, we advance a formal definition of entrepreneurial bricolage and induce the beginnings of a process model of bricolage and firm growth. Central to our contribution is the notion that companies engaging in bricolage refuse to enact the limitations imposed by dominant definitions of resource environments, suggesting that, for understanding entrepreneurial behavior, a constructivist approach to resource environments is more fruitful than objectivist views.</p>
            <p>This study explored how affect relates to creativity at work. Using both quantitative and qualitative longitudinal data from the daily diaries of 222 employees in seven companies, we examined the nature, form, and temporal dynamics of the affect-creativity relationship. The results indicate that positive affect relates positively to creativity in organizations and that the relationship is a simple linear one. Time-lagged analyses identify positive affect as an antecedent of creative thought, with incubation periods of up to two days. Qualitative analyses identify positive affect as a consequence of creative thought events, as well as a concomitant of the creative process. A preliminary theory of the affect-creativity cycle in organizations includes each of these links and proposes mechanisms by which they may operate.</p>

            <p>We examine the role of particularistic relationships (such as family and prior social ties) in business groups during institutional transition and test how particularistic ties between top leaders affect business group performance in Taiwan, where such ties have been central to the functioning of business groups. We propose that during market-oriented transition, family and prior social ties could improve group performance by providing informal norms that strengthen the intermediation within business groups and that family relationships could reduce strategic restructuring and generate performance benefits. Results of a longitudinal study over 24 years show that market transition enhanced the contribution of family and prior social relationships but not that of common-identity relationships, such as being from the same hometown, which do not involve prior direct personal contact. We also found that during transition, the positive contribution of family members would rise up to a threshold, after which additional family members tended to derail group performance, possibly due to informational disadvantages and a legitimacy discount in the eyes of foreign investors. The study helps to make sense of different predictions about the role of particularistic ties in business group performance and makes an initial attempt at revealing how social structure affects performance. Our findings have implications for research on the value of business groups in institutional transition, interorganizational relationships, and the contingencies of social relationships.</p>
            <p>Using a study on foundings of Silicon Valley law firms, I propose and test an organizational theory on the genealogical persistence of gender inequality that emphasizes the routines (or blueprints) and experiences that founders transfer from their parent firms to their new firms. This transfer links the parent firm's gender hierarchy to women's advancement opportunities in the new firm. Founders from parent firms that historically had women in leadership positions, such that female leadership is institutionalized, are more likely to found firms that promote women into prominent positions. Conversely, founders from firms that historically had women in subordinate positions, such that female subordination is institutionalized, are less likely to promote women into prominent positions. Findings are consistent with the theory and also show that the persistence effect is stronger for founders who were previously lower-ranked employees and for founders who institute an organization of work similar to their parent firm. The study suggests that future research should investigate routines and structures that not only generate gender inequality unintentionally but are in turn replicated across generations of organization through the mobility of employees.</p>

            <p>We develop and test a model of the relational antecedents of members' influence in organizations that is based on an integration of leader-member exchange (LMX) and social network perspectives on individuals in organizations. We focus on how the relationships between LMX and members' centrality in the advice network and influence depend on two factors: the extent to which members share ties with their leaders in the organization's trust network, which we define as sponsorship, and the centrality of their leaders in the advice network. Our model seeks to explain how sponsorship and leaders' centrality shape the influence members gain by virtue of their LMX relationships and their centrality in advice networks. Longitudinal data gathered from two organizations, using survey and network measures, offer strong support for a nuanced model of the relational antecedents of influence. Both LMX and members' advice centrality are related to influence, but those relationships in turn depend on sponsorship and leaders' centrality. When leaders are high in centrality, sharing ties in the trust network is beneficial: the relationship between members' own advice centrality and influence is positive among members who are high in sponsorship. But when leaders are low in centrality, sharing trust ties is detrimental: the relationship between advice centrality and influence is negative among members who are high in sponsorship and positive among members who are low in sponsorship.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce performance feedback models to specify conditions under which organizations' decision makers are more (or less) likely to accept the risk and uncertainty of nonlocal interorganizational partnership ties rather than prefer embedded ties with partners with which they have either past direct or third-party ties. Learning theory suggests that organizations performing far from historical and social aspirations may be more willing to accept the uncertainty and risk of such nonlocal ties with relative strangers. An analysis of Canadian investment banks' underwriting syndicate ties from 1952 to 1990 supports predictions from learning theory and, in addition, indicates that inconsistent performance feedback (i.e., performance above either historical or social aspirations but below the other) triggers the greatest risk taking in selecting partners.</p>

            <p>To better understand the connection between organizational identity and how organizations relate to their stakeholders, this paper introduces the construct of identity orientation, previously applied at the individual-level of analysis, at the organizational-level of analysis and proposes that organizations have three distinct identity orientations: individualistic, relational, and collectivistic. In a field study using qualitative and quantitative methods and including 1,126 participants from 88 organizations in the legal services and non-alcoholic beverage industries, I assess the constructs viability, explore its properties, and analyze its predictors at multiple levels of analysis. Results reveal that organizations' relations with stakeholders constitute a prominent feature of organizational identity, that relations with external and internal stakeholders are perceived as tightly coupled, that both pure and hybrid identity orientation types are relatively common, and that identity orientation varies widely among business organizations. Further, specific organizational variables bearing on organizations' stakeholder relations appear to be stronger predictors of identity orientation than general organizational-level or individual-level variables. Implications for a range of literatures addressing organizations' external (stakeholder management, interorganizational relations) and internal relations (human resource management, psychological contracts) are discussed.</p>

            <p>Knowledge work, which consists of goal-oriented activities that require high levels of competency to complete, comprises a large and increasing amount of work in modern organizations. Because knowledge work seldom has single correct results or methods for completion, externally specified, quantified measures of performance may not always be the most appropriate means for managing the performance of knowledge workers. Two competing models of flow, a type of subjective performance, are proposed and tested in a sample of work experiences from engineers, scientists, managers, and technicians who study and design national defense technologies at Sandia National Laboratories. Results support the definition and model that conceives of flow as the experience of merging situation awareness with the automatic application of activity-relevant knowledge and skills. Ways in which this definition and model of flow can be incorporated into theories of knowledge, performance, and social networks are explored.</p>

            <p>To date, no field research has examined the effects of overconfidence on ill-structured decisions made by managers, such as product introductions. We explored this gap in the literature and found, in a study of high-technology firms, that overconfidence was positively related to the degree to which product introductions were pioneering (risky). Further, managers introducing pioneering products were more apt to express extreme certainty about achieving success, but these products were less likely to achieve success.</p>
            <p>The governance of organizations with dispersed ownership has received academic attention for over seven decades. Early research focused largely on managerial opportunism and mechanisms for minimizing its impact on shareholder wealth. The governance landscape has dramatically changed in the past several decades with the emergence of powerful owners such as institutional investors and large blockholders, as well as increased reliance on equity-based forms of compensation. Contemporary researchers must account for the impact of these diverse owners on organizations' governance and performance. This Special Research Forum on Governance through Ownership is dedicated to furthering this rich tradition of research.</p>
            <p>Executives confront potentially conflicting pressures-maximizing shareholder wealth in the long term and appeasing shareholders in the near term. Because they must address near-term pressures to preserve tenure and to realize the benefits of long-term strategies, executives are increasingly likely to seek to mollify shareholders. We develop a behavioral-agency theoretical framework for studying how stock repurchase programs are used to help top managers appease shareholders. Analysis of 250 large U.S. firms suggested that stock repurchase programs are variously a function of information asymmetry, risky stock-based incentives, and performance expectations.</p>

            <p>Using an agency-theoretic lens and insights drawn from the behavioral economics and family business literatures, we developed hypotheses concerning the effect of dispersion of ownership on the use of debt by private family-owned and family-managed firms. A field study of 1,464 family firms was conducted. Results suggest that, during periods of market growth, the relationship between the use of debt and the dispersion of ownership among directors at family firms can be graphed as a U-shaped curve.</p>

            <p>We examined the roles of institutional investors, boards of directors, and technological opportunity in relation to international diversification. Our research contributes to both agency and foreign direct investment theories. In data on 197 large U.S. firms, we found significant relationships between institutional ownership and international diversification. International diversification was favored by (1) professional investment funds along with outside board members and (2) pension funds along with inside board members. Also, pension funds' long-term orientation facilitated internationalization in industries with high technological opportunities. The results suggest that different institutional owners have different stakes in firms' international strategies, and the effects of boards of directors and technological opportunity accentuate these differences.</p>

            <p>This study analyzes the impact of ownership structure on R&amp;D investments in the United States and Japan. It begins with the premise that U.S. and Japanese firms have distinct patterns of ownership that may result in disparities in R&amp;D investments. Agency theory and stewardship theory are used to hypothesize about the relationship between ownership and R&amp;D investments. Empirical evidence shows that the level of ownership concentration, and its impact, differ across countries. We argue that these differences result from a mixture of motives and incentives.</p>
            <p>Family-member CEOs of family-controlled firms receive lower total income than outsider CEOs, increasingly so as family ownership concentration increases. At the same time, their pay tends to be more insulated from risk and more sensitive to systematic (less controllable) business risk. The presence of institutional investors and R&amp;D intensity play important moderating roles in these relationships.</p>
            <p>In this study, a sample of group-affiliated public firms in Korea was used to examine simultaneous causality between ownership structure and performance. The results show that performance determines ownership structure but not vice versa and provide strong evidence that controlling shareholders use insider information to take direct and indirect equity stakes in profitable or promising firms and transfer profits to affiliates through intragroup trade. These findings highlight the importance of further studying the "agency problems" that controlling shareholders present for minority shareholders, especially in business groups.</p>

The findings suggest a dual-process social judgment model. In one process, person categorization, the experts used behavioral and physical cues to match "pitchers" with seven creative and uncreative prototypes. In another process, relationship categorization, the experts used relational cues and self-perceptions to match pitchers with two relational prototypes.</p>
            <p>In an empirical examination of inequity in interorganizational relationships, we found similarities and differences in Dutch and U.S. automobile dealers' reactions to inequity in their relationships with their automobile suppliers. As predicted by equity theory, both positive and negative inequity have detrimental effects on the reactions of Dutch firms. In contrast, U.S. firms do not react negatively to positive inequity; only negative inequity has deleterious effects.</p>
            <p>This study contrasts community violence and an organization's procedural justice climate (or lack thereof) as explanations for employee-instigated workplace aggression in the geographically dispersed plants of a nationwide organization. The findings showed that violent crime rates in the community where a plant resided predicted workplace aggression in that plant, whereas the plant's procedural justice climate did not.</p>
            <p>We classified newly chosen CEOs' origins into three categories: intrafirm, intraindustry, and outside-industry, and examined their firm-level and industry-level antecedents. In a sample of 220 CEO successions between 1993 and 1998, intrafirm succession was positively associated with the presence of an heir apparent and the number of nonheir inside directors. Intraindustry succession was positively associated with strategic homogeneity among industry firms and a focal firm's strategic conformity to industry central tendencies.</p>
            <p>In this study, we used Karasek's demand-control-support model to determine whether either job control or job social support or both can reduce signs of fatigue and simultaneously enhance intrinsic motivation among employees facing high job demands. Survey data on 555 nurses suggest that job control in particular reduces fatigue in highly demanding jobs, whereas high levels of instrumental support produce elevated levels of intrinsic motivation, regardless of the level of job control and job demands.</p>
            <p>This study introduces the principles of social contagion and institutional theory to human resource management by examining the top management team (TMT) hiring patterns of Fortune 500 firms. Results provide some initial but promising evidence that social environmental factors should be incorporated into human resource management theory. Specifically, results indicate that firms hired TMT members from sources with which they shared interfirm network ties and that TMT hiring patterns were shaped by mimetic isomorphism.</p>
            <p>Data from high-technology firms in Hong Kong were used to investigate whether the outcomes of problem-solving processes (solutions found, problem-solving speed, and solution quality) mediated the effects of centrifugal forces (decentralization, free flow of information, and reach) and centripetal forces (connectedness, temporal pacing, project leader expertise, and superordinate goal) on product development performance (development speed and product quality). Centrifugal and centripetal forces were indirectly related to performance through problem-solving outcomes, although some direct effects of these forces were also found. The results suggest a more complex model of product development than previously envisaged.</p>
            <p>We use social capital theory to explain how human and social capital affect a venture's ability to accumulate financial capital during its growth stages (before an initial public offering) and its performance during the two-year period after going public. Consistent with theory, data drawn from a sample of 275 ventures that went public indicate that social capital leverages the productivity of a venture's resource base and provides the venture with a durable source of competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>A qualitative study of three network marketing organizations that sell products and services using distributed workforces suggests how these organizations harvest members' work-family conflict and transform work-related ambivalence into commitment. We offer a model depicting how specific organizational practices, which we label "making workers into family" and "bringing family into work" practices lead to and maintain two types of relationship-based commitments: those based on relationships with members and those based on relationships with nonmembers. Implications for theory and practice are offered.</p>

            <p>Termination of new product development projects was examined as an advocacy process influenced by performance judgments and unobserved performance thresholds, and contextual factors related to the radicalness of such projects were studied as influences on those judgments. We applied survival analysis to four panels of data on 80 newly initiated new product development projects. Advocacy, performance judgments, and threshold effects were related to termination decisions. Contextual factors were also related to these processes.</p>
            <p>We used in-depth critical incident interviews with the external leaders of self-managing work teams and their team members, and interviews and surveys provided by managers, to understand how effective leader behaviors and strategies unfold over time. Content analyses of the data produced a process model showing that effective external leaders move back and forth across boundaries to build relationships, scout necessary information, persuade their teams and outside constituents to support one another, and empower their teams to achieve success.</p>
            <p>This article examines the relationship between a team member's functional background and two forms of intrateam involvement: centrality in a team's workflow and involvement in team decision making. It is argued that a functional background that provides valued expertise and one that is similar to the functional backgrounds of other team members will be associated with both forms of involvement; however, power centralization in a team will be a critical moderator of the decision involvement relationship. Tests of these hypotheses in a sample of business unit management teams provided strong support.</p>

            <p>We examined how a blended workforce (one with "standard" and "nonstandard" workers in the same jobs) affected exit, "voice," and loyalty among standard employees. We found that workforce blending worsened relations between managers and employees, decreased standard employees' loyalty, and increased their interest both in leaving their organizations and in exercising voice through unionization. However, these effects were contingent on whether the nonstandard workers were temporary or contract and on the salary and responsibilities of the standard employees.</p>
            <p>This cross-level study of 149 employees from 25 groups demonstrates the impact of group social context on individual interpersonal aggression. Extending the work of Robinson and O'Leary-Kelly (1998), results suggest that both being the target of aggression and the mean level of aggression in a work group (absent the target individual) are predictors of employees' reports of engaging in aggression. Effects persisted when individual differences related to aggression, demographics, and situational variables were controlled. Results suggest individual, reciprocal, and group influences.</p>
            <p>This study of 130 announcements in the Wall Street Journal illustrated a significant, positive relationship between work-family human resource initiatives and share price. Institutional theory provided the theoretical underpinning for such a relationship. Share price reactions occurring both before and after "legitimation" of a program were examined. As hypothesized, the work-family initiative and shareholder return relationship was higher in high-tech industries and, to a lesser extent, in industries with higher proportions of female employees. Implications of the results are discussed and suggestions for future research presented.</p>
            <p>In this study, we examined the postacquisition departure of target firms' CEOs and found support for the predictions of Becker's (1962) human capital theory. Firms and CEOs appear to weigh the costs of firm-specific CEO human capital investment against (1) the window of time available for returns from that investment and (2) the perceived value of those returns. CEO age and acquisition relatedness were both significantly related to the rate of CEO postacquisition departure.</p>

            <p>Data collected from 161 employees of a large firm suggest that perceived generosity is positively related to individual social status, but maintaining an equitable balance is positively related to individual productivity. Employees may address this dilemma by increasing how often they exchange favors rather than by seeking exchange equity. Frequent favor exchange was positively related to both status and productivity and strengthened the generosity-status and the balance-productivity relationships. Findings highlight the value of studying employees, particularly the favor exchange among peer frequency of exchange.</p>
            <p>We extend existing theories by linking transformational leadership to "self-concordance" at work. In two studies using diverse samples and methods, leader behaviors were associated with follower tendencies to set self-concordant goals. In general, followers of transformational leaders viewed their work as more important and as more self-congruent. The effects of self-concordant work goals on job attitudes and performance were generally positive; however, the pattern of relationships differed in the field study and the experimental study.</p>
            <p>This study examined whether the relationship between reward structure and team performance is contingent upon task dimension, team composition, and individual performance level. Seventy-five four-person teams engaged in a simulated interactive task in which reward structure was manipulated. A competitive structure enhanced one task dimension, speed, whereas a cooperative structure enhanced accuracy. Teams with extroverted and agreeable members performed better under the cooperative structure, whereas teams low on these orientations performed better under the competitive structure. Finally, reward structure had more impact on team members with low performance.</p>
            <p>Integrating research on the Pygmalion and Galatea effects with a group socialization model and theories of work motivation and interpersonal leadership, we delineated and tested a model of newcomer role performance in work teams. A two-month field study of 70 newcomers, 70 team leaders, and 102 teammates in high-tech project teams supported the model. In particular, newcomer general self-efficacy and experience predicted newcomer and team expectations, and motivational and interpersonal processes (captured by work characteristics, social exchanges, and empowerment) helped link expectations and newcomer role performance.</p>
            <p>Internal audit data of operations in a financial institution were used to examine the effects of discontinuous change and work-inherent risk on latent errors, defined here as potentially consequential deviations from procedures and policies. Results show that discontinuous change increases latent errors and that this increase varies with the level of risk. Implications for organizational research on errors and reliability are discussed.</p>
            <p>This study tests a model of creative role identity for a sample of Taiwanese employees. Results showed creative role identity was predicted by perceived coworker creativity expectations, self-views of creative behaviors, and high levels of exposure to U.S. culture. Creativity was highest when a strong creative role identity was paired with perceptions that the employing organization valued creative work. Implications for managers and future creativity research are discussed.</p>
            <p>In this study, we argue that media-provided information affects investors' impressions of newly public firms. In 225 initial public offerings (IPOs), the volume of media provided information had a negative, diminishing relationship with underpricing and a positive, diminishing relationship with stock turnover on the first day of trading. The relationship between the tenor of media-provided information and underpricing increases at a nonlinear rate, and decreases similarly for turnover. Findings provide important evidence that publicly available information not only reflects IPOs' legitimacy, but also adds to their legitimacy and influences investor behavior.</p>

We examined investors' reactions to the differing incentive properties of stock options and equity ownership in the context of firms undertaking initial public offerings (IPOs). We found that stock options and equity ownership interacted to influence the premiums that investors applied to IPO firms. We suggest that the effectiveness of CEO stock options may depend on the level of CEO equity.</p>

            <p>I base an integrated model of innovation development and launch on the behavioral theory of the firm. This model specifies that research and development expenses are increased when low performance causes "problemistic search" and when excess resources cause "slack search." Innovations generated by search are launched if low performance gives managers high risk tolerance. Using data from shipbuilding firms, I show that high performance reduces R&amp;D intensity and innovation launches, and high slack increases R&amp;D intensity, as predicted.</p>
            <p>Using a sample of 290 employees and their supervisors from 46 Korean companies, we found that (1) transformational leadership was positively related to follower creativity, (2) followers' "conservation," a value, moderated that relationship, and (3) intrinsic motivation mediated the contribution of the interaction of transformational leadership and conservation and partially mediated the contribution of transformational leadership to creativity. We discuss implications of these results for research and practice.</p>
            <p>A questionnaire study of 129 members of 20 multidisciplinary project teams examined the relationship between informational dissimilarity and both team identification and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) for individuals working under different interdependence configurations. Results revealed that under congruent low-low and high-high combinations of task and goal interdependence, informational dissimilarity was unrelated to team identification and OCB. By contrast, under incongruent low-high and high-low combinations of task and goal interdependence, informational dissimilarity was negatively related to team identification and OCB. Team identification partially mediated the relationships between the predictors and OCB.</p>
            <p>How likely are multinational enterprises (MNEs) to use expatriate parent country nationals to staff culturally distant subsidiaries? How does their employment affect subsidiary performance? The agency theory prediction is that MNEs will rely more heavily on parent country nationals as cultural distance increases and that this reliance will weaken over time. Both agency theory and the "resource-based view" suggest that a positive effect of expatriate staffing on subsidiary performance increases with cultural distance but decreases over time. Results largely supported the predictions in data on Japanese foreign subsidiaries.</p>

Specifically, we examine the relationships between a set of network-building HR practices, aspects of the external and internal social networks of top management teams, and firm performance. Results from a field study with 73 high-technology firms showed that the relationships between the HR practices and firm performance (sales growth and stock growth) were mediated through their top managers' social networks.</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between organization-level compensation decisions and organizational performance. Specifically, we examined how companies' pay structures and pay levels relate to resource efficiency, patient care outcomes, and financial performance. We expected both nonlinear and interactive effects. Results from a large database of hospitals support our predictions. We discuss the implications for practice and compensation research theory development in light of the study's results.</p>
            <p>This study's examination of demography, personal, and social identity related to functional background offers insights about individuals' performance in cross-functional teams. We considered both the interaction between identity and dissimilarity with other team members and the interaction between identity and membership in a team's minority or majority. In explaining the relationship between identity and an individual's performance as a cross-functional team member, minority/majority membership interacted significantly with identity, but actual degree of dissimilarity did not.</p>
            <p>This study shows that the strategies of service firms affect the uncertainty they encounter in their dealings with customers. This strategically induced uncertainty then becomes the mechanism by which service firms organize their production processes. In a study of 234 service firms representing 96 different industries, we found strong support for relationships between these organizations' strategies and the level of complexity in their production processes. In addition, service firms that possessed the hypothesized fit between strategy and service production complexity tended to experience higher performance.</p>
            <p>Agency theory dominates research on equity holdings-firm performance relationships; however, extant studies provide no consensus about the direction and magnitude of such relationships. Consistent linkages have not been demonstrated for firm performance and CEO, officer, director, institutional, or blockholder equity. We conducted a series of meta-analyses of relevant empirical ownership-performance studies. The meta-analyses provide few examples of systematic relationships, lending little support for agency theory. We propose a substitution theory perspective for future ownership-performance research.</p>
            <p>This study reexamines the relationships between corporate diversification strategies and firm performance and suggests that these relationships are related to home country environments. We examined two environmental aspects: factors that facilitate transformational activities and institutions that foster transactional activities. Using a sample of firms from six Western European countries, we found support for the study's central proposition, that home country environment is an important component in the study of corporate diversification strategies.</p>
            <p>We model the governance strategies adopted by suppliers to safeguard relationship-specific investments in asymmetric interorganizational relationships using two dimensions: quasi integration and joint decision making. Data from a field study of 211 supplier-retailer relationships support the research model. Domain knowledge specificity arising from relationship-specific intellectual capital investments emerges as the most influential determinant of governance. The results provide preliminary but powerful evidence of the value of intangible assets in interorganizational relationships.</p>
            <p>Managerialism is a theory that suggests that managers extract pay premiums by gaining control over their firms' compensation processes. Human capital theory suggests instead that pay premiums reflect executives' superior managerial abilities. This study tests a contingency perspective in which the source of pay premiums depends on executives' power and firms' governance strength. Results suggest pay premiums are a consequence of human capital in some firms and managerial entrenchment in others. Several implications are offered to guide future inquiry.</p>
            <p>The knowledge-based theory of the firm suggests that, as knowledge intensity increases, knowledge management concerns, not opportunism, should increasingly drive organizational boundary decisions. Therefore, as R&amp;D intensity increases, knowledge-based theory should gain explanatory power over transaction cost economics, in which opportunism is the primary driver. However, this study shows problems of opportunism increasing with R&amp;D intensity. For example, as R&amp;D intensity increased, managers actively discouraged bidding wars. Transaction cost economics seems to gain explanatory power as knowledge intensity grows.</p>

            <p>Affective delivery, or expressing positive emotions in service interactions, helps satisfy customers. But employees cannot always feel positive and, to avoid breaking display rules, may act. Surface acting (modifying facial expressions) and deep acting (modifying inner feelings) were tested as predictors of stress and of coworker-rated affective delivery. Consistent with a dramaturgical perspective, affective delivery ratings were negatively related to surface acting but positively related to deep acting. Surface acting, but not deep acting, was related to stress.</p>
            <p>We developed and tested a model in which supervisors' procedural justice perceptions lead to supervisors' organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), supervisors' OCB leads to subordinates' procedural justice perceptions, and in turn, subordinates' procedural justice perceptions directly influence subordinates' OCB. Using data collected from 373 National Guard members and their military supervisors, we found support for the mediation framework as well as for the prediction that individuals' OCB role definitions (that is, the extent to which they define OCB as extrarole) moderate the relationships between justice perceptions and OCB performance.</p>
            <p>This study proposes gaining a new understanding of group development by considering the integrative and the punctuated equilibrium models of group development as complementary rather than competing. We hypothesized that we would observe both punctuated equilibrium and linear progression in content-analyzed data from 25 simulated project teams, albeit on different dimensions. We predicted changes in time awareness and in task and pacing activity in line with the punctuated equilibrium model and changes in structure and process on task and socioemotional dimensions in line with the integrative model. Results partially supported predictions for both models.</p>
            <p>In this article I develop a framework for thinking about the research interview, and I critique dominating neopositivist and romantic views on the interview. I suggest eight metaphors that offer reconceptualizations of the interview, drawing upon recent theoretical trends on language, the subject, and discourse, and develop a reflexive theoretical framework. The article provides new ways of dealing with interviews, along with implications for fieldwork interaction with subjects, interpretations of empirical material, and research questions possible or suitable to address based on interviews.</p>

            <p>I present two models for exploring the impact of the emergence and diffusion of the internet on vertical and horizontal firm boundaries. I argue that the effect of the emergence and diffusion of the internet on a firm's boundaries is a function of the firm's determinants of costs, moderated by the information dependence and tacitness of the firm's value-adding activities and the organizational technology that underpins the firm's primary activities. Contrary to previous research, the models suggest that the emergence and diffusion of the internet should also expand some firm boundaries.</p>
            <p>Economic and sociological theories explaining bandwagon behaviors, along with cognitive and behavioral theories of decision making, do not fully address the process whereby decision makers choose whether or not to jump on bandwagons. In this article we model the interactions between mindfulness as a decision-maker characteristic and the decision-making context, and we show the impact of those interactions on managers' ability to discriminate in the face of bandwagons. We illustrate the framework by applying it to recent integration and disintegration bandwagon behaviors in the U.S. health care market.</p>

            <p>We integrate perspectives from the literature on contingency, dynamic capabilities, and the natural resource-based view of the firm to propose how dimensions of the general competitive environment of a business will influence the development of a dynamic, proactive corporate strategy for managing the business-natural environment interface. We also explain how certain characteristics of the general business environment-uncertainty, complexity, and munificence-moderate the relationship between the dynamic capability of a proactive environmental strategy and competitive advantage. We conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.</p>

            <p>We explore the association between the context of social relationships and individual creativity. We go beyond a one-dimensional treatment of social relationships, highlighting the importance of both static and dynamic social network concepts. We argue that weaker ties are generally but not always beneficial for creativity, propose the network positions that facilitate and constrain creative work, and describe three moderators. A spiraling model is presented, capturing the cyclical relationship between creativity and network position. Collectively, our propositions describe an individual's creative life cycle in terms of network position.</p>
            <p>In this article we integrate the power, justice, and prosocial literature on whistle-blowing with the attribution and emotion literature to develop a social information processing model. This model illustrates how individuals' attributions and responsibility judgments for wrongdoing, as well as their cost-benefit analyses of acting, influence their emotions and decisions to blow the whistle. In addition, we demonstrate how wrongdoers can use impression management tactics to manipulate whistle-blowing decisions.</p>
            <p>Using a poststructuralist view of managerial practice, we elaborate the notion of working appreciatively by focusing on the contested, emergent meaning of appreciation. We begin by articulating a set of concerns regarding the traditional treatment of appreciation within managerial practice and suggest that working with appreciation requires cultivating an appreciative spirit. An appreciative spirit is enhanced when managers develop (1) an appreciation for the life enhancing, (2) an appreciation of the connection between spirit and technique, and (3) an appreciation for reflexivity.</p>
            <p>There is a growing belief among some that employee empowerment provides the most appropriate basis for designing and implementing new organizations. However, from a structural perspective, empowerment represents a moral hazard dilemma for managers, with the possibility of control loss and decreased organizational outcome. While there are several mechanisms for tempering the potential downside of empowerment, we focus on two: organizational constitutions and the development of trusting relationships. We present six specific propositions relating to organizational constitution and trust as controls for tempering the potential downside of empowerment.</p>
            <p>Using social movement and social identity theories, we construct a model of stakeholder group action that challenges the current notion that interests drive stakeholder group action. We argue that interests do not easily translate into action, mobilization can be motivated by a desire to express an identity as well as protect interests, and overlapping (similar) memberships across multiple stakeholder groups affect stakeholder group action. As a result, we develop several propositions based on our elaboration of interest-based action and inclusion of identity-based action.</p>
            <p>We use a narrative perspective to explore the relevance of the sciences dealing with ecology for management theory and practice, presenting the issues of ecoscience from the perspective of green narrative, based on the "evolutionary epic." Adopting an interpretive sensemaking perspective on narrative, we address the narratological basis of the evolutionary epic and examine the potential for the narrative to inform a new relationship between management and the natural environment. We suggest implications for management theory and practice by examining elements of the narrative.</p>
            <p>We develop a contingency view of process management's influence on both technological innovation and organizational adaptation. We argue that while process management activities are beneficial for organizations in stable contexts, they are fundamentally inconsistent with all but incremental innovation and change. But dynamic capabilities are rooted in both exploitative and exploratory activities. We argue that process management activities must be buffered from exploratory activities and that ambidextrous organizational forms provide the complex contexts for these inconsistent activities to coexist.</p>

            <p>
            <p>A persistent theme in the academic literature on technological innovation is that incumbent enterprises have great difficulty crossing the abyss created by a radical technological innovation and, thus, go into decline, while new entrants rise to market dominance by exploiting the new technology. However, this tendency is not universal. There are outliers in any population, and much can be learned from examining this group. Here we identify a number of factors that help to explain incumbent performance in markets shaken by a radical technological innovation.</p>

            <p>How do organizations make strategic choices during the time of fundamental institutional transitions such as those sweeping numerous emerging economies? To answer this question, a two-phase model of institutional transitions is developed in this article. I focus on the longitudinal process to move from a relationship-based, personalized transaction structure calling for a network-centered strategy to a rule-based, impersonal exchange regime suggesting a market-centered strategy. I then identify the points of inflection; predict strategic choices for incumbent, entrepreneurial, and foreign firms; and delineate their performance implications.</p>

            <p>Linking theories of social capital with theories of multinational corporations (MNCs), we discuss the need for and creation of social capital in foreign subunits of MNCs. We argue that the required levels and forms of social capital are determined by the nature of interdependence between headquarters and subunits, and thus vary by different models of MNCs. We then develop a micro-macro model of social capital formation, explaining how boundary spanners form their private social capital and how this social capital is transformed into public social capital of the subunit.</p>

            <p>In this paper I use the psychological literature on grief to explore the emotion of business failure, suggesting that the loss of a business from failure can cause the self-employed to feel grief--a negative emotional response interfering with the ability to learn from the events surrounding that loss. I discuss how a dual process of grief recovery maximizes the learning from business failure.</p>

            <p>The field of corporate governance is at a crossroads. Our knowledge of what we know about the efficacy of corporate governance mechanisms is rivaled by what we do not know. This special topic forum is dedicated to continuing the rich tradition of research in this area, with the hope that the models and theories offered will propel corporate governance research to the next level, enhancing our understanding of those governance structures and mechanisms that best serve organizational functioning.</p>
            <p>Boards of directors serve two important functions for organizations: monitoring management on behalf of shareholders and providing resources. Agency theorists assert that effective monitoring is a function of a board's incentives, whereas resource dependence theorists contend that the provision of resources is a function of board capital. We combine the two perspectives and argue that board capital affects both board monitoring and the provision of resources and that board incentives moderate these relationships.</p>

            <p>
            <p>Corporate governance is an increasingly provocative topic, evident in ongoing debates between proponents of control versus collaborative approaches. We accommodate these contrasting approaches within a paradox framework, using agency and stewardship theories to elaborate the underlying tensions and to emphasize the value of monitoring, as well as empowerment. Building from these tensions, we examine reinforcing cycles that foster strategic persistence and organizational decline. We conclude by discussing means of managing control and collaboration, highlighting the implications for corporate governance.</p>
            <p>We develop theory to show how board composition and, consequently, firm performance are a reflection of both the firm's life cycle stage and the relative power of the CEO and external financiers at the time of founding. This theory provides insight into the predictive validity of agency, resource dependence, institutional, and social network theories. We also argue that boards are subject to path dependency, and, thus, board composition is likely to persist over time.</p>

            <p>I describe how board structures influence the decision-making processes that investors use when purchasing shares of firms undertaking initial public offerings (IPOs). IPO firms are relatively unknown to investors and suffer from a liability of market newness. I rely on signaling theory, institutional theory, and sociological research on prestige to suggest that investor perceptions of board prestige signal organizational legitimacy, thereby reducing the liability of market newness and improving IPO firm stock performance. I also propose that the characteristics of investors, namely prestige, influence their perceptions of board prestige.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical model to describe and explain variation in corporate governance among advanced capitalist economies, identifying the social relations and institutional arrangements that shape who controls corporations, what interests corporations serve, and the allocation of rights and responsibilities among corporate stakeholders. Our "actor-centered" institutional approach explains firm-level corporate governance practices in terms of institutional factors that shape how actors' interests are defined ("socially constructed") and represented. Our model has strong implications for studying issues of international convergence.</p>

            <p>This note addresses both CEO leadership development and the control of managerial opportunism in the CEO-board relationship through an evolutionary perspective. Based on the analysis of the evolution of CEOs' leadership and power, I propose that boards need to focus on CEO leadership development in early CEO tenure, but to shift toward the control of managerial opportunism as CEOs prove their leadership on the job. I also discuss measures that may influence CEO leadership development in early CEO tenure and/or the control of managerial opportunism in later CEO tenure.</p>
            <p>Despite increasing attention given to mutual forbearance strategies (MFS), researchers have virtually ignored the internal arrangements necessary for their implementation. We argue that the design of the mutual forbearance competitor may pose some unique implementation challenges for the firm, theorize about the administrative mechanisms that we expect to characterize firms implementing MFS, and suggest that, to the extent that future researchers do not model the qualities theoretically necessary to implement MFS, the full competitive consequences of MFS will not be appreciated.</p>
            <p>
            <p>We discuss four key types of work interruptions-intrusions, breaks, distractions, and discrepancies-having different causes and consequences, and we delineate the principle features of each and specify when each kind of interruption is likely to have positive or negative consequences for the person being interrupted. By discussing in detail the multiple kinds of interruptions and their potential for positive or negative consequences, we provide a means for organizational scholars to treat interruptions and their consequences in more discriminating ways.</p>
            <p>We develop theory specifying the role of ownership in the employment relationship and address how sharing in ownership's privileges can create convergent psychological contracts between workers and employers. We specify two factors limiting the attractiveness of ownership for some workers--that is, the potential for internal conflict among worker/owners transitioning to this dual role and the risks that ownership entails--and also outline a research agenda to investigate how allocating ownership to workers impacts their interests and those of managers and investors.</p>
            <p>We recommend the inclusion of "ideological currency" in the psychological contract perspective in order to broaden the range of employee-organization exchanges that the perspective can accommodate. We differentiate ideological currency from other forms of exchange currency and develop a model that articulates the conditions under which the breach and violation of ideology-infused psychological contracts will likely occur. We conclude by considering the opportunities and challenges implied by the inclusion of ideology in the psychological contract.</p>
            <p>We propose a social dilemma approach to cooperation induction in multiparty alliances. We first establish that managing the inherent tension between cooperation and competition in alliances is essentially a social dilemma, where an individually rational but socially defecting choice may lead to a higher payoff for an individual partner but where, once all partners adopt such a strategy, the alliance will fail. We then develop propositions on how partners can improve their chances for cooperation, and we discuss the limitations of the social dilemma approach and its implications for future research.</p>

            <p>We examine the referent selection process of host country national (HCN) employees. We outline the conditions under which they are more likely to select expatriate colleagues as comparative referents and suggest that, when this occurs, they are likely to experience relative deprivation. We also highlight the role of national culture in the process. Our model shifts the focus of overseas assignments research from the expatriate to the HCN, and it also has important practical implications for multinational enterprises sending employees overseas.</p>
            <p>There are two streams of research on deviance in the management literature, one on its positive effects and one on its negative effects. Although the underlying behavior is the same-a departure from norms-these two research streams remain separate. Here I review the literature, develop an integrative typology of deviance, and call for further advancements with respect to identifying reference groups and establishing normative standards.</p>
            <p>Facades of conformity are false representations created by employees to appear as if they embrace organizational values. I present a conceptualization of the facades of conformity construct and propose that organizational reward systems, minority status, and self-monitoring are examples of variables likely to serve as antecedents to creating facades of conformity. I also propose that psychological and emotional distress are potential outcomes to facade creation. I conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications for continued research on facade creation.</p>
            <p>I contribute to complementarities theory by defining synergies in an organizational dispute resolution system with respect to how components interact. Disputants must be able to use any component for any conflict, and multiple ones to address the same conflict. Drawing on insights from both organizational behavior and industrial relations theories, I present propositions about how complementarities affect individual outcomes, and I conclude with implications for dispute resolution and other complementarities research and practice.</p>
            <p>Using a game theoretic approach and integrating research on managerial succession, family businesses, and transaction cost economics, we examine how the degree of idiosyncrasy of a family business and the ability of the family's offspring affect succession. Contrary to the popular belief that successors to family businesses are often offspring because of nepotism, we propose an economic rationale that this is due to the appropriation risk and the agency paradox that family businesses encounter in engaging agents.</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate a central tenet of the resource-based view of the firm-that tacit knowledge often lies at the core of sustainable competitive advantage-and attempt to articulate it with greater theoretical precision than has been done previously. Using data from the National Basketball Association, we find support for a predicted positive relationship between shared team experience and team performance that declines as shared experience grows, eventually becoming negative. The implications of this study for non-sports-related firms are discussed along with suggestions for future research.</p>

            <p>Relatively little research explores observed differences in pay dispersion across organizations and whether those observed differences have consequences for employee behaviors. Using data from two managerial compensation samples, we found that an organization's context-its environment and diversification strategy-is related to differences in pay dispersion across firms. We also found that pay dispersion within an organization is related to the tenure of managers and the likelihood of their leaving the organization.</p>
            <p>This study examines the role of professional associations in a changing, highly institutionalized organizational field and suggests that they play a significant role in legitimating change. A model of institutional change is outlined, of which a key stage is "theorization," the process whereby organizational failings are conceptualized and linked to potential solutions. Regulatory agencies, such as professional associations, play an important role in theorizing change, endorsing local innovations and shaping their diffusion.</p>
            <p>This study tests a theory of how a craft- and profession-based industry adopted multidivisional organization, examining higher education publishing from 1958 through 1990. I combined interviews and historical analysis to identify two institutional logics, an editorial and a market logic. Hazard rate models of differences in the effects of these logics showed a decrease in the importance of professional determinants of organization structure and an increase in the salience of its market determinants. The covariates explaining the rate at which firms divisionalized changed as a consequence of their strategic and structural conformity with the prevailing institutional logic.</p>
            <p>We integrate resource dependency and institutional theory to argue that resource scarcity drives, and legitimacy enables, institutional change. Building on a historical account, we examine the sources and timing of innovation departing from standard human resource practices using event history analysis of over 200 principal offices of large law firms. Offices with human resource scarcity innovated to acquire alternative resources; highly prestigious offices had the legitimacy to be first or early adopters. Our findings highlight the value of looking to the resource side and to the notion of legitimacy in building an institutional theory of change.</p>

            <p>We examine how the immigration of leaders possessing different skills, understandings, assumptions, and values can promote change within institutionalized organizations and fields. Our results indicate that American liberal arts colleges were more likely to adopt controversial professional programs during the 1970s and 1980s when led by presidents who had recently migrated either from colleges that had professional programs or from lower-status colleges.</p>

            <p>This article examines the diffusion of a novel governance structure, the so-called partner-associate structure, among a population of Dutch professional services firms during the period 1925-90. An institutional change emerged out of an interaction between selection at the level of sector and imitative adoption at the firm level. We argue that market feedback regarding the novel structure fostered its legitimacy. Furthermore, the effect of market feedback is conditional upon three diffusion filters: social networks, propinquity, and strategic group membership. Diffusion as a legitimization process unfolds, therefore, at both the sectoral and the firm level of analysis.</p>

            <p>Reporting on a longitudinal case study of the introduction of business planning and performance measures in cultural organizations, this article uses Weber's identification of types of rationality as a means to illuminate institutional and organizational change. The study illustrates how conflict that accompanies change coalesces around different dimensions of rationality-substantive, practical, theoretical, and instrumental-that inform organization members' understandings of organizational and professional identity and management practices.</p>
            <p>We examine how technical and institutional factors affect the responsiveness of public and private organizations to a change in accreditation standards. We found that market niche and ties to an accrediting organization affected the responsiveness of both types of organizations. However, technical factors (potential economic gains from accreditation) had a greater effect on the responsiveness of private organizations, and institutional factors (diffusion through both social cohesion and structural equivalence) had a greater effect on the responsiveness of public organizations.</p>
            <p>The institutional entrepreneurship implicit in a firm's sponsorship of its technology as a common standard is beset by several challenges. These challenges arise from a standard's property to enable and constrain even as potential competitors agree to cooperate on its creation. Our exploration of Sun Microsystems's sponsorship of its Java technology suggests that standards in the making generate seeds of self-destruction. Our study also identifies the social and political skills that a sponsor deploys to address these challenges.</p>

            <p>We examine the adoption of an organizational practice by subsidiaries of a multinational corporation (MNC) under conditions of "institutional duality." Drawing on institutional theory, we identify two factors influencing the adoption of a practice: the institutional profile of the host country and the relational context within the MNC. We also specify conditions leading to "ceremonial adoption." General support is found for the model based on data from 534 managers and 3,238 nonmanagerial employees in 104 subsidiary locations from ten countries.</p>
            <p>In this article, I present an analysis of institutionalization as an interplay between three interrelated yet separate components-actors, actions, and meanings. Drawing on ethnographic data of a rape crisis center in Israel, where the entry of therapeutically oriented members resulted in the infusion of new meanings into originally feminist practices, I examine the role of organization members as carriers of institutions and their (possible) agency in infusing actions with meanings through interpretation; how meanings connect actors with actions; and institutional meanings as political resources.</p>

Drawing on a historical analysis of the field of finance in the United States and evidence on professional finance association foundings, I show how a transformation in the logics guiding the field and development of financial expertise shaped the professionalization of finance occupations from 1945 through 1993.</p>

            <p>An organization's identity, symbolized by its corporate name, is rooted in institutional fields. We advance the construct of symbolic isomorphism, or the resemblance of an organization's symbolic attributes to those of others within its institutional field, and examine its effects on the homogenization of names and legitimacy. We review historical naming patterns and present two studies that examine the antecedents and outcomes of name conformity: The first analyzes 1,600 name changes to demonstrate how institutional conformity shapes organizational identities, and the second surveys public audiences and delineates how symbolic isomorphism serves as a touchstone for legitimacy.</p>
            <p>We argue that collaboration can act as a source of change in institutional fields through the generation of "proto-institutions": new practices, rules, and technologies that transcend a particular collaborative relationship and may become new institutions if they diffuse sufficiently. A four-year study of the collaborative activities of a small nongovernmental organization in Palestine suggests that collaborations that are both highly embedded and have highly involved partners are the most likely to generate proto-institutions.</p>
            <p>Using a sample of blue-collar workers and drawing from managerial control theory, we derived and tested an integrative model of employee drinking behavior focusing on four key sets of work-related risk factors: (1) workplace culture, (2) alienation, (3) stress, and (4) policy enforcement. Our results suggest that perceived permissive drinking norms are the strongest direct predictor of employee problem drinking. Such norms also both mediate and moderate the effects of stress and policy enforcement variables on problem drinking, but the mediational effects may have higher explanatory potential. Implications for the management of counterproductive employee behaviors are discussed.</p>
            <p>In a constantly changing business environment, firms with access to those who make public policy enjoy competitive advantage. To gain such access, politically active firms engage in a variety of tactics. Modeling the determinants of corporate political activity as a single, multivariate phenomenon, we demonstrate that politically active firms combine tactics. We also show that political activism, institutional features of Congress, firm size, government contracts, and industry concentration drive firms to use multiple political tactics.</p>
            <p>This study examines institutional change in the founding patterns of "interest associations" in U.S. health care during an era of redefinition of this organizational field. When this domain's major governance structure and ideology eroded, key actors fragmented, and alternative logics emerged. I looked at how the social organization of associations can affect field-level governance and at how both variables can change during this major institutional shift. The results suggest that the founding patterns of two institutionally distinct types of interest associations differ with respect to field-level changes.</p>

            <p>Examining the relationship between governance and corporate innovation strategies, we found, in opposition to the assumption that owners have a unified voice, differences among governance constituencies' preferences for corporate innovation strategies. The managers of public pension funds preferred internal innovation, but professional investment funds' managers preferred acquiring external innovation. The profiles of boards of directors also shaped these innovation strategies. Inside directors with equity emphasized internal innovation, and outside directors with equity emphasized external innovation. The two types of fund manager equally preferred boards composed of outsider representatives with equity. However, pension fund managers preferred inside directors with equity more strongly than did professional investment fund owners.</p>

            <p>Highlighting the importance of succession context, this study examines the performance impacts of successor type, postsuccession senior executive turnover, and departing CEO tenure. Following a power circulation theory of control, we distinguished three types of CEO successors: followers, contenders, and outsiders. Our theory and evidence from a sample of 228 CEO successions suggest that successor type interacts with postsuccession senior executive turnover to influence firm return on assets (ROA) and that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between departing CEO tenure and postsuccession firm ROA.</p>
            <p>In a longitudinal, randomized field experiment, we tested the impact of transformational leadership, enhanced by training, on follower development and performance. Experimental group leaders received transformational leadership training, and control group leaders, eclectic leadership training. The sample included 54 military leaders, their 90 direct followers, and 724 indirect followers. Results indicated the leaders in the experimental group had a more positive impact on direct followers' development and on indirect followers' performance than did the leaders in the control group.</p>
            <p>We examined the effects of unsystematic and systematic firm risk on CEO compensation risk bearing and total pay. Both the proportion of variable pay in CEO pay packages and their magnitude are curvilinearly related to unsystematic firm risk-that is, they are highest under conditions of moderate firm-specific risk. Our results are consistent with agency theory predictions that both performance-contingent pay and the greater earnings potential associated with that form of pay are highest when an agent has greater control over performance outcomes.</p>
            <p>We examined relations between creative performance and the extent to which employees received support for creativity from both work (supervisors/coworkers) and nonwork (family/friends) sources. We also examined whether (1) employees' mood states mediated the support-creativity relations and (2) creative personality characteristics moderated these relations. Results demonstrated that work and nonwork support made significant, independent contributions to creative performance. Positive mood mediated these relations, and employees with less creative personalities responded most positively to nonwork support.</p>
            <p>Applying the agency theory perspective, we examined the relationship between board structure and the average political risk of firms' international manufacturing operations in a sample of 95 manufacturing firms from the Fortune 500. Our results indicate an association between board composition, CEO duality, and the level of international political risk present in a corporation's portfolio of foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p>To examine antecedents and consequences of learning in the context of mentoring relationships, we developed a new measure of personal learning, relational job learning and personal skill development. The presence of a mentor and mentoring functions were found to be antecedents of personal learning. Job satisfaction, role ambiguity, intentions to leave a job (turnover intentions), and actual leaving (turnover) were found to be consequences of personal learning. This study also explored personal learning as a mediator between mentoring functions and organizational consequences. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>
            <p>Do rivals' alliances increase or decrease the competitive pressure experienced by a firm? Linking ecological and economic research on organizations, we propose that the effects of rivals' horizontal, upstream, and downstream alliances are determined by the degree to which they (1) foreclose a focal firm's alliance opportunities and (2) increase industry carrying capacity. We also hypothesize that firms can co-opt rivals' alliances by partnering with well-linked rivals. An analysis of Canadian biotechnology firms supports these predictions.</p>

            <p> We examined how local employees of international joint ventures (IJVs) perceived disparity between their compensation and foreign expatriates' compensation from equity theory and social justice perspectives. Chinese locals perceived less fairness when comparing their compensation with expatriates' than when comparing it with other locals'. However, fairness vis-√°-vis expatriates increased if the locals were compensated higher than their peers in other IJVs or endorsed ideological explanations for expatriates' advantage. Furthermore, expatriates' interpersonal sensitivity toward locals reduced the effect of disparity on perceived fairness. Finally, perceived compensation fairness was related positively to compensation satisfaction but negatively to intentions to quit. </p>
            <p>Research in entrepreneurship and life cycle theories of the firm have both suggested that new ventures may outgrow the managerial capabilities of their founding teams, at which point the founders may be replaced by professional managers. This study explored factors affecting founder departure. Results indicate that founder departure increases with firm size, decreases with founder ownership and board membership, and has a U-shaped relationship with firm growth. Founders who work in research and development or who are chief executives are also less likely to leave.</p>
            <p>Through an analysis of an entire institutional history of pricing conventions in the on-line database field during 1971-94, this study documents and explains institutional development in emerging and turbulent fields. The dialectic process model developed and illustrated here suggests that inherent contradictions and opposition, generated and reinforced by institutionalization, serve as internal sources of continuous dialectic contest. Fused with external developments, the process by which these endogenous potentials develop is path-dependent and is central to their realization in the form of overt institutional stability or change.</p>

            <p>Functional diversity in teams has been conceptualized in a variety of ways without careful attention to how different conceptualizations might lead to different results. We examined the process and performance effects of dominant function diversity (the diversity of functional experts on a team) and intrapersonal functional diversity (the aggregate functional breadth of team members). In a sample of business unit management teams, dominant function diversity had a negative, and intrapersonal functional diversity, a positive effect on information sharing and unit performance. These findings suggest that different forms of functional diversity can have very different implications for team process and performance and that intrapersonal functional diversity matters for team effectiveness.</p>

            <p>We investigated how work context leads to employee self-definition. We propose that the employees of organizations whose values and organizing principles center on fulfilling employees' needs and acting in their best interests will report higher levels of organization-based self-esteem. Further, we argue that perceptions of organizational fairness and job authority mediate this relationship through the social-psychological process of reflected appraisal. Results based on analyses of data from a sample of 186 managers and professionals from 69 different organizational settings support our model.</p>
            <p>The relationship between perceived participative decision making and employee performance was examined in matched samples of employees from the Hong Kong and U.S. branches of one organization. Self-efficacy in regard to participating in decisions and idiocentrism moderated the relationship between perceived participative decision-making opportunity and individual performance. Perceptions of the participation efficacy of a work unit and allocentrism moderated the relationship between participative decision-making opportunity and group performance. Idiocentrism and allocentrism appeared to explain regional differences in how participative decision making and efficacy perceptions interacted to predict performance.</p>

            <p>Despite a growing sense that speed is critical to organizational success, how an emphasis on speed affects organizational processes remains unclear. We explored the connection between speed and decision making in a 19-month ethnographic study of an Internet start-up. Distilling our data using causal loop diagrams, we identified a potential pathology for organizations attempting to make fast decisions, the "speed trap." A need for fast action, traditionally conceptualized as an exogenous feature of the surrounding context, can also be a product of an organization's own past emphasis on speed. We explore the implications for research on decision making and temporal pacing.</p>
            <p>This article investigates the use of visual artifacts to represent time. Timelines, or "Gantt charts," are widely used for scheduling, budgeting, and project management, and they are woven into the fabric of organizational life. Timelines embody objectivist, monotemporal assumptions about time yet allow organizational and occupational subgroups with different assumptions to negotiate and manage time prospectively and retrospectively. Timelines thus function as temporal boundary objects, visual representations of time that are both interpretively flexible and robust.</p>
            <p>In an effort to reconcile theoretical "blind spots," we integrated research in technology management, organizational ecology, and evolutionary economics. The central premise underlying the resultant model is that time conditions the effects of age, contemporaneous size, order of entry, and contemporaneous density on mortality rates. We tested our hypotheses using a life cycle approach and data on 33 product innovations that span most of the 20th century. Results resoundingly support our central thesis on the impact of time on both survival rates and relationships previously thought to be universalistic.</p>

            <p>This study is an investigation of how the age of the knowledge that firms search affects how innovative they are. Two seemingly contradictory propositions are examined: (1) old knowledge hurts by making innovation activities obsolete and (2) old knowledge helps because its reliability and legitimacy promote innovation. Results based on longitudinal data on 131 robotics firms reconcile the contradictory propositions: while old intraindustry knowledge hurts, old extraindustry knowledge promotes innovation.</p>
            <p>In this article, I offer theoretical and empirical groundwork for the study of intergenerational issues and highlight the relevance of intergenerational behavior to organizations. I focus on situations involving conflict between generations in which a present generation must give up benefits or take on burdens to act on the behalf of future generations. I introduce the notion of intergenerational reciprocity and, in four studies, found that the behavior of previous generations influences how a present generation treats future generations.</p>

            <p>Time serves as a medium for collaboration in teams, allowing members to exchange personal and task-related information. We propose that stronger team reward contingencies stimulate collaboration. As time passes, increasing collaboration weakens the effects of surface-level (demographic) diversity on team outcomes but strengthens those of deep-level (psychological) diversity. Also, perceived diversity transmits the impact of actual diversity on team social integration, which in turn affects task performance. Results from four waves of data on 144 student project teams support these propositions and the strong relevance of time to research on work team diversity.</p>
            <p>Attention to time is generally regarded as the catalyst that motivates groups to pace work under deadlines. We tested this assumption in 38 groups, some working under stable deadlines and others working under changed deadlines. Our results indicate that groups steadily increase attention to time as deadlines near, rather than sharply increasing such attention at the midpoint, but they engage in task transitions at or near the midpoint of allotted time.</p>
            <p>Extending understanding of time as a metric and a punctuation device for the work of groups, we conceptualize time pacing as a semistructure, a structure that increases flexibility for addressing ambiguous tasks. Semistructures enable group members to interrupt their work to "stop and think," evaluate the work, and develop alternative work strategies. Using data from 80 experimental groups, we found that midpoint transitions and time pacing emerged under various, although not all, conditions. Familiarity among group members and formal instructions, both of which provide semistructures, promoted the occurrence of midpoint transitions and temporal pacing.</p>
            <p>The current study examines the direct and moderating effects of human capital on professional service firm performance. The results show that human capital exhibits a curvilinear (U-shaped) effect and the leveraging of human capital a positive effect on performance. Furthermore, the results show that human capital moderates the relationship between strategy and firm performance, thereby supporting a resource-strategy contingency fit. The results contribute to knowledge on the resource-based view of the firm and the strategic importance of human capital.</p>
            <p>This research investigates relationships between caregiving decisions and work-family outcomes-well-being, performance in work and family roles, and work-family conflict-occurring as a function of dependent type and work and family climates. We compared effects of caregiving decisions regarding place and provider for child and elderly dependents in climates encouraging or discouraging sacrifice and sharing concerns. Well-being and performance were lowest with in-home elder care by a family member, in work or family climates that discouraged sharing concerns.</p>
            <p>This study employed transaction cost theory to explore factors moderating the relationship between collaboration and performance in foreign markets among a sample of international new ventures. Results indicated that R&amp;D intensity and advertising intensity were significant moderators of this relationship; however they were not significantly related to the use or nonuse of collaboration. Besides enhancing understanding of international new ventures, these results provide advances in understanding the relationship between collaboration and firm performance that may also motivate future research on large multinational enterprises.</p>

            <p>This article develops a theoretical model that examines the moderating effect of perceived technological uncertainty on new product development (NPD). We tested the theoretical model using 553 Japanese NPD projects. We found that cross-functional integration, marketing and technical project synergy, and proficiency in marketing and technical development activities differentially contribute to project performance under conditions of high and low perceived technological uncertainty. Japanese project managers differentially focus NPD efforts on these factors according to the level of perceived technological uncertainty.</p>
            <p>Drawing on data based on the entire population of Spanish newspapers over 27 years (1966-93), this study shows that firm performance and business risk are much stronger predictors of chief executive tenure when a firm's owners and its executive have family ties and that the organizational consequences of CEO dismissal are more favorable when the replaced CEO is a member of the family owning the firm. The study also demonstrates that executives operating under weakly relational (less ambiguous) contracts are held more accountable for firm performance and business risk outcomes, even under nonfamily contracting.</p>
            <p>The need for coordinated decision making bears on the pay gap between a firm's CEO and its other top executives. A behavioral view suggests that because more equal pay promotes collaboration, greater coordination needs encourage smaller pay gaps, and the combination of greater needs and smaller gaps enhances firm performance. An economic view implies the opposite because larger gaps create tournament-like incentives that address monitoring problems associated with joint decisions. We found that although economic theory was a better predictor of the size of CEO pay gaps, there was a balance between the economic and behavioral views as predictors of firm performance.</p>

            <p>When adaptation requires innovation, or the creation of variety, exploration is crucial. High levels of exploration thus imply variance-seeking rather than mean-seeking learning processes. In a study of 56 new business development projects, given high exploration, organizational learning was more effective when the projects operated with autonomy with respect to goals and supervision. As degree of exploration decreased, better results were associated with less autonomy on both counts. This contingent effect persisted even when I controlled for the emergence of deftness and comprehension.</p>
            <p>Using data from 48 Fortune 500 firms, we assessed transactional and charismatic CEO leadership as predictors of financial performance. We also hypothesized that the relationship between CEO leadership attributes and performance depends on perceived environmental uncertainty, as reported by immediate CEO subordinates. Uncertainty strongly moderated the relationships between performance (measured in later years) and both transactional leadership and charisma. However, the interaction of transactional leadership and uncertainty had no significant effect beyond that of the charisma-uncertainty interaction. Consistent with expectations, charisma predicted performance under conditions of uncertainty but not under conditions of certainty.</p>
            <p>Researchers have assumed that large ownership stakes held by institutional investors grant them power to influence R&amp;D investments. We found that ownership alone was insufficient and that institutions resorted to activism to influence R&amp;D investments. Institutional activism increased R&amp;D inputs over both the short and long terms. The nature of the activism and the strategic context of the R&amp;D investment moderated the relationship. Further, R&amp;D inputs mediated the effect of activism on R&amp;D outputs.</p>

            <p>We explored the relationship between the degree to which total quality management (TQM) practices were adopted within organizations and the corresponding competitive advantages achieved. We found relatively strong support for this relationship. In addition, our data showed some support for the moderating influence of organizational structure on TQM implementation effectiveness. Specifically, two measures of organizational structure, labeled "control" and "exploration," were found to offer independent and interdependent influences on the financial performance of firms implementing TQM programs.</p>
            <p>Using data from electric utilities, this study shows that spending on well-designed regulations has a positive productivity impact but that spending on less well-designed regulations has a negative effect. Better-designed regulations are flexible and grant firms latitude on how to meet goals, allow them time to deploy new means to meet goals, and set ambitious goals that stretch them beyond current practices.</p>
            <p>Study results indicate a positive association between use of high-involvement work practices and employee retention and firm productivity. A disordinal interaction was indicated: employee turnover was associated with decreased productivity when use of high-involvement work practices was high and with increased productivity when use of these practices was low.</p>
            <p>The performance of 94 groups on 13 different open-ended tasks was studied. At the individual-team-member level, domain knowledge and performance-relevant behavioral measures of the three components of Amabile's (1983, 1996) theory of individual creativity related in predicted ways to individual differences. Support was found for new "cross-level" processes, labeled "team creativity-relevant processes." At the group level, these processes moderated the relationship between aggregated individual creativity and group creativity.</p>
            <p>An interactive model of social undermining and social support in the workplace was developed and tested among police officers in the Republic of Slovenia. As predicted, social undermining was significantly associated with employee outcomes, in most cases more strongly than was social support. High levels of undermining and support from the same source were associated with negative outcomes. However, support from one source appeared to only modestly attenuate the negative effects of social undermining from another source.</p>

            <p>We examined the effect of work group processes (charismatic leadership and communication-cooperation) on the evolution of group potency among newly formed work groups. Results showed that these processes affected changes in group potency over time, that initial performance mediated these effects, and that group potency was related to subsequent group satisfaction, group effort, and group performance. Group potency also mediated the relationships between work group processes and group effort and performance.</p>
            <p>We examined the relationships between multiple life roles, psychological well-being, and managerial skills in two studies of managerial women. Qualitative results suggested that the roles women play in their personal lives provide psychological benefits, emotional advice and support, practice at multitasking, relevant background, opportunities to enrich interpersonal skills, and leadership practice that enhance effectiveness in the management role. Quantitative results indicated that multiple role commitment positively related to life satisfaction, self-esteem, and self-acceptance. Commitment to multiple roles was also related to interpersonal and task-related managerial skills.</p>

            <p>In industries characterized by network externalities, a single technology standard often rises to dominance, locking out competing technologies. This research demonstrates that despite "path dependency," it is possible to model the technology selection process and predict likely outcomes. This work extends previous work in network externalities by demonstrating that in addition to its "installed base" and the availability of complementary goods, a firm's learning orientation and timing of entry also play significant roles in its success.</p>
            <p>In this study, we examined the moderating effects of individual differences and sources of support on the negative relationship between work-family conflict and career satisfaction. Data from 975 managers indicated that the relationship was significant for women irrespective of age but was significant for men only in later career. Moreover, the relationship was stronger for individuals who were in the minority gender in their work groups, but it was weaker for those who had strong community ties. Implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>We propose a network effects model of charisma that specifies the distribution and change of charisma attributions among individuals connected in a social structure. Data from a police organization and a classroom setting were analyzed using social network methods. The results show that social network parameters are significantly associated with the distribution and dispersion of attributions of charisma. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical significance for understanding the socialized aspects of charisma attributions.</p>
            <p>This study of 157 users of new technologies implemented in manufacturing demonstrates complex relationships between technology characteristics, users' learning activities, and implementation outcomes. Technology characteristics affected both implementation outcomes and users' learning activities. On balance, technology characteristics explained more variance in user "speed to competence" and the quality of learning activities explained more variance in user satisfaction. Technology and learning activities independently affected implementation outcomes, with no evidence of mediation or moderation.</p>
            <p>Firms' increasing use of external labor arrangements has been difficult to reconcile with resource-based propositions concerning the development of organizational capabilities. We tested hypotheses drawn from the transaction costs perspective to predict which jobs firms would fill through external arrangements rather than through traditional employment relationships. The findings may help to explain the apparent paradox between the increasing externalization of workers and their use as a source of sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>Examining commercial lending decisions, we found that increased monitoring of decision makers and changing decision makers attenuated escalation of commitment but also produced unintended effects. Some decision makers resisted downgrading the risk borrowers in the face of organizational intervention, exhibiting "intervention avoidance," and escalated commitment to these borrowers. Combined findings indicate organizations need to carefully address both the intended and potential unintended consequences of systems designed to attenuate escalation of commitment.</p>
            <p>Managers from 24 geopolitical entities provided data on work locus of control, job satisfaction, psychological strain, physical strain, and individualism/collectivism. The hypothesis that the salutary effects of perceived control on well-being are universal was supported because relations of work locus of control with well-being at work were similar in almost all the sampled areas. Furthermore, the individualism/collectivism level of each sample did not moderate the magnitude of correlations of work locus of control with measures of well-being. Findings indicate that control beliefs contribute to well-being universally, but we suggest that how control is manifested can still differ.</p>
            <p>Research on acquisitions has typically focused on acquisitions per se, examining issues such as performance and implementation problems. This study moves beyond that perspective and studies the influence on a firm's later expansions. We argue that exploitation of a firm's knowledge base through "greenfields" eventually makes a firm simple and inert. In contrast, acquisitions may broaden a firm's knowledge base and decrease inertia, enhancing the viability of its later ventures. Over time, firms strike a balance between the use of greenfields and acquisitions. Various implications of this theory-tested with survival analysis and "logit" models-were strongly corroborated.</p>

            <p>Executive stock ownership and stock option pay are often assumed to have congruent incentive effects; however, these incentives have asymmetrical risk properties, and executives may respond to them in different ways. This study, which examined the effects of ownership and option pay, showed that they had diametrically opposite effects on firms' acquisition and divestiture propensity. Moreover, situational characteristics moderated the risk-seeking behavior associated with stock option pay but not the risk aversion associated with ownership.</p>
            <p>We develop resource- and dynamic capability-based arguments that CEOs with international assignment experience create value for their firms and themselves through their control of a valuable, rare, and inimitable resource. Supporting this view, U.S. multinationals performed better with CEOs with international assignment experience at their helms, especially when such human capital was bundled with other organizational resources and capabilities. Moreover, in highly global firms, CEOs with international assignment experience appropriated a greater proportion of performance in their pay.</p>
            <p>This article describes a field study in which insights from the resource-based view of the firm were combined with models of capital investment decision making to investigate the decision processes used to make capital investments in capabilities. The study shows that different decision processes are used to invest in existing and new capabilities and that current models in the literature need to be adapted to capture the differences, which relate primarily to information requirements and management roles. The results suggest adopting a contingency approach to managing capital investment in capabilities.</p>
            <p>The complexity surrounding globalization offers a unique context in which to study the moderating role of uncertainty on top management team (TMT) demographic effects. In a sample of United States-based industrial firms, TMT international experience, educational heterogeneity, and tenure heterogeneity were positively related to firms' global strategic postures, and functional heterogeneity exhibited a negative association. However, when the level of uncertainty facing TMTs was accounted for, these associations were found to be nonlinear.</p>
            <p>A model of cross-functional project groups was developed and hypotheses were tested in a study of 93 research and new product development groups from four companies. The results showed that functional diversity had indirect effects through external communication on one-year-later measures. Technical quality and schedule and budget performance improved, but group cohesiveness diminished. Functional diversity also had an indirect effect through job stress on group cohesiveness, which was again reduced. Implications for the development of conceptual models of cross-functional groups and their effective management are discussed.</p>
            <p>Using a field survey of 461 self-managing work team members in four countries, we examined: (1) whether employee resistance to such teams mediated the relationships between employee cultural values and job attitudes and (2) whether the value-resistance relationships were stronger in some countries than in others. Results show that resistance mediated the cultural value-job attitude relationships, sometimes fully and sometimes partially, depending on which type of resistance (to teams or to self-management) and which type of cultural value was being examined. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</p>
            <p>Prior research reports of a weak commitment-performance relationship can be attributed to inconsistency in conceptualization and measurement of the constructs. In this study, we differentially relate attitudinal commitment to internal (organization and supervisor) and external (customer) foci to objective measures of job performance. Results suggest that both internal foci are related to organizationally rewarded job performance and that the external focus influences job performance relevant to and rewarded by customers. Implications of these findings are discussed.</p>
            <p>In this field experiment, we first compared the performance effects of money systematically administered through the organizational behavior modification (O.B. Mod.) model and routine pay for performance and then compared the effects of O.B. Mod.- administered money, social recognition, and performance feedback. The money intervention based on the O.B. Mod. outperformed routine pay for performance (performance increase = 37% vs. 11%) and also had stronger effects on performance than social recognition (24%) and performance feedback (20%).</p>
            <p>Building on demography theories, we study the effects of organizational sex composition at different job levels on the turnover of men and women at the same or lower levels. We found that women were less likely to leave when more women were employed at their job level but that the effects of the proportions of women immediately above and in executive levels varied with women's rank. Men's turnover was not significantly affected by the proportions of men at or immediately above their job level but decreased when more men were employed in executive levels.</p>
            <p>Although recruitment is a practical strategy young and poorly connected firms can use to overcome constraints on product innovation, it has received little attention. Younger firms and poorly connected firms have lower rates of product innovation than their advantaged counterparts and recruit more from rivals to surmount resource constraints. Younger firms recruit veterans, and poorly connected firms poach from large firms. However, recruit characteristics have stronger effects on product innovation in poorly connected organizations.</p>
            <p>The foreign expansion of firms is treated as an instance of organizational and strategic change shaped by structural inertia and imitation. A longitudinal analysis of South Korean firms in China shows that business group experience and imitation among firms from the same home-country industry increase the rate of foreign expansion. Industry imitation effects tend to decrease after a firm makes its first foreign entry.</p>
            <p>This article examines interactions between internal and external drivers of alliance formation. We argue that firms' use of alliances as a mechanism to adapt to market uncertainties is contingent on internal resource conditions. The results indicate that, in volatile markets, resource-rich firms access external resources through alliances whereas resource-poor firms are less likely to do so. However, in relatively stable markets, this relationship reverses, and resource-poor firms become more active in alliance formation.</p>
            <p>Successful product development requires managing tensions-coping with fluctuating contingencies to foster innovation and efficiency. To investigate this challenge, we explored the nature, dynamics, and impacts of contrasting project management styles. Our conceptual framework details emergent and planned styles. Following 80 projects over two-year periods, we find that these styles offer disparate but interwoven approaches to monitoring, evaluation, and control activities; use of these activities fluctuates over time; a paradoxical blend of styles enhances performance; and uncertainty moderates project management-performance relationships.</p>
            <p>We examined the relationship between the ownership structure and financial performance of 334 Japanese corporations for the 1986-91 period. The positive relationship we found between ownership concentration and financial performance is consistent with agency theory predictions. In addition, we observed a more pronounced profit redistribution effect characterized by the transferring of financial resources from more to less profitable firms. These findings indicate the need to account for both economic incentives and social context in corporate governance research.</p>

            <p>Supply chains are increasingly important, yet little is known about the determinants of their success and failure. Drawing on the resource-based view and research on "adhocracy," in this study we examined the effects of cultural competitiveness within supply chains on order fulfillment cycle time. The results indicate that entrepreneurship, innovativeness, and learning function as first-order indicators of a higher-order latent construct we label "cultural competitiveness" that, in turn, has a positive effect on cycle time reduction.</p>
            <p>This study examined the relationship between human resource practices, employee quit rates, and organizational performance in the service sector. Drawing on a unique, nationally representative sample of call centers, multivariate analyses showed that quit rates were lower and sales growth was higher in establishments that emphasized high skills, employee participation in decision making and in teams, and human resource incentives such as high relative pay and employment security. Quit rates partially mediated the relationship between human resource practices and sales growth. These relationships were also moderated by the customer segment served.</p>
            <p>Our theoretical argument is that the effect of acquisition-related factors on CEO compensation is contingent upon the intensity of monitoring activities. In firms with vigilant monitors, returns will explain changes in CEO compensation. In firms with passive monitors, increased corporate size due to an acquisition will explain compensation changes. We found support for our hypotheses in a sample of 171 acquisitions over the 1993-98 time period.</p>
            <p>Building on the knowledge-based view of the firm, we examine the effects of experience and complexity on decisions to staff product-line extensions with shared or dedicated managers. Results suggest that new and old product lines are more likely to share a manager when the organization possesses a base of knowledge related to the extension and when the new product is low in complexity. These results extend understanding of knowledge and product platforms by focusing on implementation and resource deployment.</p>
            <p>Supplier perspective taking, whereby an internal customer adopts the perspective of an internal supplier, was investigated. Two dimensions were assessed: positive attributions and empathy. Supplier perspective taking was associated with team leader ratings of employees' contextual performance. Production ownership and integrated understanding predicted supplier perspective taking and were in turn predicted by job autonomy. Interaction with suppliers contributed to supplier perspective taking directly and indirectly. These findings suggest two ways to enhance supplier perspective taking and hence contextual performance: increase employee interaction with suppliers and enrich job content.</p>
            <p>A new construct, entitled "job embeddedness," is introduced. It includes individuals' (1) links to other people, teams, and groups, (2) perceptions of their fit with job, organization, and community, and (3) what they say they would have to sacrifice if they left their jobs. We developed a measure of job embeddedness with two samples. The results show that job embeddedness predicts the key outcomes of both intent to leave and "voluntary turnover" and explains significant incremental variance over and above job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job alternatives, and job search.</p>
            <p>Investigating the effect of product innovation strategy on the performance of new technology ventures in China, we found the innovation-performance link was contingent on both environmental factors, including environmental turbulence and institutional support, and the relationship-based strategies of the ventures, such as strategic alliances for product development and political networking. Our results suggest the need for simultaneous consideration of environment- and relationship-based strategy factors as moderators in the discourse on product innovation strategy among new technology ventures.</p>
            <p>The transition from an economy based on materials to an economy based on flows of information has created considerable challenges for organization design by unfettering many organizational aspects from physical constraints. We view the resulting new organizational forms as coping with four core issues: interdependence, disembodiment, velocity, and power. The nine articles in this special research forum provide evidence on how forms have changed, as well as on which aspects of traditional theorizing are likely to continue to be robust. Core themes reflected are an acceptance of contradiction and paradox, a shift in the goal of organizing from buffering against uncertainty to responding to it, a strategic focus on structure and process design, a reemphasis on the social and interpersonal, and a reemergence of issues of legitimacy.</p>

            <p>In many industries, integrated hierarchical organizations have been replaced by nonhierarchical entities that are permeable, interconnected, and modular. Other industries, however, maintain relatively high levels of integration. We use the logic of general systems modularity to explain why in some industries there is a greater use of modular organizational forms, including contract manufacturing, alternative work arrangements, and alliances, than in other industries. This model was tested using data from 330 U.S. manufacturing industries.</p>

            <p>Analyses of founding and mortality rates of specialist organizations in the U.S. wine industry over the period 1941-90 support Carroll's (1985) location-based resource-partitioning model-crowding of generalists in the market center creates opportunities for specialists. Further, specialists are adversely affected when they violate their organizational form's identity characteristics and also when generalists can assume a robust identity allowing them to operate in both specialist and generalist industry segments. The results suggest a prominent role for an organizational form's identity in resource partitioning.</p>

            <p>This study investigated the nature and extent of organizational change in the context of globalization through a longitudinal matched-pair analysis of two leading pharmaceutical companies. The structures of common processes in each firm were empirically characterized over time. Findings suggest that MNCs respond to complex global competitive environments by increasing internal structural complexity, a systematically differentiated structural response to relevant process subenvironments. Though supporting the existence of characteristics associated with projected MNC models, the study showed systematic variations in these characteristics across internal structures.</p>

            <p>Building on transaction cost economics and the knowledge-based theory of the firm, I argue that, following a technological change that is competence-destroying to firms and their suppliers, firms that are integrated vertically into the new technology will perform better than those that are not. At the same time, firms that had been vertically integrated into the old technology will perform worse than those that had not been. This argument suggests that the efficient boundaries of a firm are dynamic. I used the adoption of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) technology by makers of computer workstations to explore the hypotheses.</p>
            <p>Based on an intensive and inductive study of a Fortune 100 corporation, this article describes how dynamic capabilities that reconfigure division resources-that is, architectural innovation-may operate within multibusiness firms. We suggest envisaging corporate divisions as combinations of capabilities and product-market areas of responsibility (charters) that may be recombined in various ways, highlighting the interplay of economic and social imperatives that motivate such recombinations. We detail the microsociological patterns by which such recombinations occur and then theorize about an organizational form, termed "dynamic community," in which these processes are embedded.</p>

Specifically, we evaluated the moderating role of a temporal coordination mechanism, process structure, on the relationship between conflict management behavior and virtual team performance. An experiment was conducted with 35 five-person teams in the United States and Japan. Our findings show that the way virtual teams manage internal conflict is a crucial factor in their success and that temporal coordination has some significant moderating effects.</p>

            <p>In hypercompetitive environments, the established paradigms of sustainability of competitive advantage and stability of organizational form may have limited applicability. Using an in-depth case analysis of the firms Yahoo! and Excite, this study examines how the organizational form, function, and competitive advantage of these firms dynamically coevolved. The study introduces the concept of continuous morphing to describe the comprehensive ongoing transformations through which the focal firms sought to regenerate their transient competitive advantage on the Internet.</p>

            <p>The incident command system (ICS) is a particular approach to assembly and control of the highly reliable temporary organizations employed by many public safety professionals to manage diverse resources at emergency scenes. Our inductive study of a fire department's use of the ICS identified three main factors enabling this distinctively bureaucratic system to produce remarkably flexible and reliable organizations for complex, volatile task environments. This research suggests the possibility of new organizational forms able to capitalize on the control and efficiency benefits of bureaucracy while avoiding or overcoming its tendencies toward inertia.</p>
            <p>Feminist bureaucracy, a response to a historical tension between feminist theorists and practitioners, merges opposed models of power. Through qualitative analysis of power in practice, I examine the novelty and viability of feminist bureaucracy as a distinct hybrid form I term "organized dissonance." This form of organization upsets the conventional view that rationality requires resolution, suggesting the potential of strategic incongruity. It also underscores the significance of structure-practice and partner-environment relationships.</p>

            <p>Emphasizing that both general job availability and individual attributes determine actual ease of movement in the job market, I propose a voluntary turnover model that combines aspects of signaling and human capital perspectives with approaches emphasizing job satisfaction and general job availability. Longitudinal data on 5,506 individuals were analyzed via survival analysis with time-dependent covariates and repeated turnover events. Most notably, the effects of job satisfaction and unemployment rate on voluntary turnover were moderated by education, cognitive ability, and occupation-specific training.</p>
            <p>This study examines how external network ties determine a board's ability to contribute to the strategic decision making process. Although the simple number of director appointments to other boards does not affect board monitoring or advice on strategy, appointments that can provide directors with relevant strategic knowledge and perspective do predict such involvement. In effect, the strategic context of social network ties, not simply the number of ties, is an important influence on corporate governance.</p>
            <p>This study explores how organizational learning in subunits affects outflows of knowledge to other subunits. Three learning processes are explored: Collecting new knowledge, codifying knowledge, and combining old knowledge. The results suggest that collecting new knowledge intensifies vertical flows, of knowledge, that codifying knowledge facilitates horizontal and vertical flows, and that combining old knowledge mainly affects horizontal flows. More generally, the study suggests that uncertainties about the relevance of new knowledge are resolved via vertical flows, which (compared to horizontal flows) expose new knowledge faster to a wider range of remote and different knowledge and thereby facilitate faster, more comprehensive discovery of its relevance.</p>

            <p>This study focused on the conditions under which job dissatisfaction will lead to creativity as an expression of voice. We theorized that useful feedback from coworkers, coworker helping and support, and perceived organizational support for creativity would each interact with job dissatisfaction and continuance commitment (commitment motivated by necessity) to result in creativity. In a sample of 149 employees, as hypothesized, employees with high job dissatisfaction exhibited the highest creativity when continuance commitment was high and when (1) useful feedback from coworkers, or (2) coworker helping and support, or (3) perceived organizational support for creativity was high.</p>
            <p>In this study, we examined 82 accounts of "issue selling" to better understand managers' implicit theories for successfully shaping change from below by directing the attention of top management. The study reveals the importance of various issue-selling moves, including packaging, involvement, and timing. Managerial accounts uncover three kinds of contextual knowledge that are critical to the execution of issue-selling moves. The study shows managers actively shaping the issue-selling microprocesses that contribute to organizational change.</p>
            <p>We propose a model of gainsharing as an organizational learning system. Analyzing employee suggestions submitted over the first four years of a gainsharing plan at one plant, we found that although conventional explanations of how gainsharing works predicted changes in the volume of total suggestions, changes in their content were consistent with an organizational learning process. Suggestions indicating "first-order learning" were initially high but declined over time as a percentage of total suggestions, and suggestions congruent with "second-order learning" became a larger portion of the total suggestions over time.</p>

            <p>We conceptualize discourse as a duality of communicative actions and deep structures, mediated by the modality of interpretive schemes, and develop a discourse analysis methodology based on the fields of hermeneutics and rhetoric. We then explore the role of discourse in shaping organizational change processes through its influence on actors' interpretations and actions, using a longitudinal field study of electronic trading implementation in the London Insurance Market. We conclude with some theoretical and practical contributions on discourse-practice links, the illumination of multiple perspectives in change processes, and implications for electronic data interchange implementation.</p>

            <p>Increasing competition resulting from the global and technological nature of markets has heightened the need for businesses to rely on cross-functional new product teams to produce innovations in a timely manner; yet functionally diverse teams' inevitable disagreements often appear to prevent this. In a study of 43 such teams, we found that the effect of task disagreement on team outcomes depended on how free members felt to express task-related doubts and how collaboratively or contentiously these doubts were expressed. Implications for managing the journey from disagreement to agreement in cross-functional new product teams are discussed.</p>
            <p>This article presents evidence for an incremental change process in decision-making groups whereby change unfolds through self-generated interruptions. Group members initiate self-interruptions by switching their attention to social concerns (in familiar groups) or to discussion instructions (in groups using formal interventions). During such interruptions, members evaluate activities, propose alternative approaches, and change working strategies. Results suggest that familiarity and formal interventions provide flexible structures that lead to superior performance. A central finding reveals that using a formal intervention in familiar groups hurts performance because preestablished interaction patterns are altered.</p>
            <p>In this article, we draw on five case studies in health care organizations to develop a process theory of strategic change in pluralistic settings characterized by diffuse power and divergent objectives. The creation of a collective leadership group in which members play complementary roles appears critical in achieving change. However, collective leadership is fragile. We identify three levels of "coupling" between leaders, organization, and environment that need to be mobilized to permit change. Since it is difficult to maintain coupling at all levels simultaneously, change tends to proceed sporadically, driven by the effects of leaders' actions on their political positions.</p>

            <p>A new framework that addresses how tight fit among a firm's activities affects the firm's ability to react to environmental changes is presented. As part of the framework, a new classification scheme for environmental changes is developed. I argue that fit-conserving change, which leaves the internal fit among a firm's activities intact yet decreases the appropriateness of the set of choices as a whole, poses a particularly difficult challenge for managers. A longitudinal case study of the fashion apparel company Liz Claiborne illustrates the framework.</p>

            <p>By defining strategy as a sequence of competitive actions carried out over time, I develop and test a dynamic process model of competitive interaction among firms. Results based on a sample of thousands of competitive actions carried out by rivals competing in 16 different industries over a seven-year period suggest that characteristics of firms' sequences of competitive actions account for differences in their relative performance. The findings also suggest that a firm's sequence of competitive actions is influenced by top management team heterogeneity, past performance, slack, and three important industry characteristics.</p>
            <p>This paper develops a resource-based perspective for predicting the sequencing of a firm's resources that best provides for firm growth. The sequencing that generated the highest firm growth combines a Penrosian (1959) perspective with the more recent resource-based literature. This resource development path may be generalizable to other industries, such as airlines, telecommunications, and railroads, that have been deregulated.</p>
            <p>In this study, we propose a process framework for understanding the evolution of intraindustry firm heterogeneity, drawing on a longitudinal study of the development of the cellular telephone service business in seven "Baby Bells." The framework depicts market, competitive, and organizational forces whose dynamic interplay shapes a process in which diversity among firms within an industry is created, magnified, and sustained. It elucidates path dependence in firm evolution and highlights possible roles for management in affecting that path.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory wherein the pay of non-CEO executives can be explained by micro-level opportunity structures-the intersection of functional position, CEO background, human capital, and firm strategic resource allocation decisions. Our theory suggests a positive association between pay and a position made visible by resource allocation decisions, a functional background similar to that of the CEO, and a position that helps the firm manage strategic resource allocations. A unique longitudinal data set that combines survey and archival data on the four highest echelons of senior executives in large U.S. firms provided support for this multilevel framework.</p>
            <p>Past studies have consistently shown that firms favor past partners when forming new alliances. This behavior has been associated with a need to have knowledge of potential partners' capabilities and reliability. We consider inertia as an alternative rationale. Inertia and evaluation factors were tested in the context of underwriting syndicate formations in the U.S. investment banking industry. The results suggest both inertia and several evaluation criteria, including reciprocity, experience, and prior performance, influence partner selection.</p>
            <p>This study tested hypotheses concerning how similarity of personality traits between promotion candidates and their peers and supervisors influences promotion decisions in different work unit cultures. Personality similarity to peers was positively associated with promotion in units with high individualism. In units with high collectivism, supervisor-subordinate personality similarity was instead a significant predictor of advancement. Behavioral integration between candidates and their peers and supervisors partially mediated the influence of personality similarity on promotion. Demographic similarity had little influence on promotion decisions. We discuss implications for understanding similarity effects and for increasing the validity of promotion decisions.</p>
            <p>Using data from two different firms, this study tested a new construct, creative self-efficacy, tapping employees' beliefs that they can be creative in their work roles. Results support the discriminant validity of the construct and indicate that job tenure, job self-efficacy, supervisor behavior, and job complexity contribute to creative efficacy beliefs. Creative self-efficacy also predicted creative performance beyond the predictive effects of job self-efficacy. Differences in results between white-collar and blue-collar samples suggest considerations for both theory and practice.</p>
            <p>A sample of 154 new auditors was surveyed to investigate how patterns of social relationships affected socialization. Characteristics of the newcomers' informational networks (size, density, strength, range, and status) related to three different indicators of learning: organizational knowledge, task mastery, and role clarity. Also, the structure of the newcomers' friendship networks related to their social integration and organizational commitment. By linking socialization outcomes to social network structure, this study sheds new light on the role of relationships in newcomer learning and assimilation.</p>
            <p>The present study tested dispositional goal orientation as an explanation for variation in responses to high job demands. Survey data from 322 university employees demonstrated that job demands were positively related to fatigue, for all combinations of goal orientation. In line with our main proposition, only when an individual's performance orientation was stronger and his or her mastery orientation was weaker, were higher perceived job demands accompanied by a decline in job satisfaction. The managerial implications of these findings are discussed.</p>

            <p>We explore how CEO power affects the repricing of executive options. The spread between an option's exercise, or strike, price, and the market value of a stock impacts the likelihood of repricing. This effect is enhanced when the CEO of the firm in question is also the chairman of its board. Firm and CEO visibility, more board members appointed after a CEO's hiring than before it, a staggered board, and relatively high percentages of CEO and institutional ownership reduce the impact of the spread on the likelihood of repricing.</p>
            <p>We examine how firms search, or solve problems, to create new products. According to organizational learning research, firms position themselves in a unidimensional search space that spans a spectrum from local to distant search. Our findings in the global robotics industry suggest that firms' search efforts actually vary across two distinct dimensions: search depth, or how frequently the firm reuses its existing knowledge, and search scope, or how widely the firm explores new knowledge.</p>
            <p>Following a power perspective, this study is a longitudinal examination of the antecedents of CEO dismissal followed by inside succession. Our theory highlights interest conflicts and competition within top management. We propose that CEO origin, CEO tenure, non-CEO inside directors, and senior executive ownership are important antecedents of CEO dismissal followed by inside succession. Evidence from a sample of 387 large U.S. corporations suggests that non-CEO senior executives frequently play an important role in CEO dismissal.</p>
            <p>In this study, we tested a model in which threats and opportunities lead directly to different organizational actions and compared it to a model in which organizational characteristics moderate organizational actions taken in response to threats and opportunities. To better understand these effects, we differentiated the dimensions of threat and opportunity associated with the threat-rigidity hypothesis from the dimensions associated with prospect theory. In this study, threats had the main and moderated effects predicted from the literature, but opportunities did not.</p>

            <p>Drawing from social categorization theory, we found that greater demographic heterogeneity led to group norms emphasizing lower cooperation among student teams and officers from ten business units of a financial services firm. This effect faded over time. Perceptions of team norms among those more demographically different from their work group changed more, becoming more cooperative, as a function of contact with other members. Finally, cooperative norms mediated the relationship between group composition and work outcomes.</p>

            <p>This study generalized a leading portrayal of how job dissatisfaction progresses into turnover (Hom &amp; Griffeth, 1991) and more rigorously tested this model using structural equations modeling and survival analysis. We further integrated job avoidance, interrole conflict, and employment conditions into this framework. Using a national survey of retail store personnel, we found that interrole conflict and job avoidance influence turnover indirectly, as the Hom-Griffeth model specifies, and that unemployment rates directly affect turnover.</p>

            <p>In a field quasi experiment, customers were most satisfied with the service quality of the branch of a multinational bank where good organizational citizens had been trained as service quality leaders, and branch employees exhibited the highest conformance to the quality scheme of the bank. In a branch where service quality leaders were randomly selected for training, customer satisfaction and conformance improved more than they did in a branch where no service quality leaders were trained.</p>
            <p>Drawing on a network perspective on organizational learning, I argue that organizational units can produce more innovations and enjoy better performance if they occupy central network positions that provide access to new knowledge developed by other units. This effect, however, depends on units' absorptive capacity, or ability to successfully replicate new knowledge. Data from 24 business units in a petrochemical company and 36 business units in a food-manufacturing company show that the interaction between absorptive capacity and network position has significant, positive effects on business unit innovation and performance.</p>
            <p>In this study, I aimed to assess if traits and interpersonal support helped explain advancing in management from entry level to upper management, including gender differences in the links of interpersonal support. After human capital and promotion opportunities, managerial aspirations and masculinity were the strongest predictors of advancing in management. Male hierarchies predicted women's advancing less than men into lower and middle management, and career encouragement predicted women's advancing more to upper management, both as compared to declining to lower levels than men.</p>
            <p>This study focuses on the antecedents and consequences of displayed emotion in organizations. I propose that customers "catch" the affect of employees through emotional contagion processes. Results indicate that the display of positive emotion by employees is positively related to customers' positive affect following service encounters and to their evaluations of service quality. In a replication and extension of prior research, transaction busyness and employee emotional expressiveness are shown to predict displays of emotion by employees.</p>
            <p>This study integrates research on the financial performance of multinational firms with research on foreign subsidiary survival. We examined the influences a firm's intangible assets and its experience have on foreign subsidiary survival and profitability using a sample of 3,080 subsidiaries of 641 Japanese firms. The results show survival and profitability have different antecedents. Host country experience has a direct effect on survival but a contingent relationship with profitability. The entry mode moderated the nature of these relationships.</p>
            <p>Activation theory suggests that intermediate rather than low or high levels of quantitative job demands benefit job performance and job satisfaction among managers. Using an equity theory framework, I hypothesize that perceptions of effort-reward fairness moderate these inverted U-shaped demand-response relationships. In support of this hypothesis, survey results demonstrate that managers who perceive effort-reward fairness perform better and feel more satisfied in response to intermediate levels of job demands than managers who perceive "underreward unfairness."</p>
            <p>Employees' organizational identification was measured in three organizations. Results show that employee communication augments perceived external prestige and helps explain organizational identification. Communication climate plays a central role, mediating the impact on organizational identification of the content of communication. The relative impacts of employee communication and perceived external prestige on organizational identification differ between organizations; this was attributed to differences in reputation of the companies. Consequences of the results for the management of organizational identification are discussed.</p>
            <p>A model integrating competing theories of social capital with research on career success was developed and tested in a sample of 448 employees with various occupations and organizations. Social capital was conceptualized in terms of network structure and social resources. Results of structural equation modeling showed that network structure was related to social resources and that the effects of social resources on career success were fully mediated by three network benefits: access to information, access to resources, and career sponsorship.</p>
            <p>In a longitudinal study, we found that higher group performance was associated with a particular pattern of conflict. Teams performing well were characterized by low but increasing levels of process conflict, low levels of relationship conflict, with a rise near project deadlines, and moderate levels of task conflict at the midpoint of group interaction. The members of teams with this ideal conflict profile had similar pre-established value systems, high levels of trust and respect, and open discussion norms around conflict during the middle stages of their interaction.</p>
            <p>"Heirs apparent" are frequently a central component of CEO successions but have been largely ignored in the succession literature. Our study examines heir apparent tenures and two contrasting outcomes-promotion to CEO and firm exit. We propose that the distribution of power among an incumbent CEO, outside directors, and an heir apparent influences these outcomes. Results suggest that outside director and CEO power are important influences on heir promotion and exit and that heirs who arise from within a firm are less likely to exit.</p>
            <p>Three research theories used to explain firm boundaries are transaction cost economics, an options perspective, and a resource-based view of the firm. Our integrated model addresses the degree to which each of these three perspectives explains firm boundaries for technology sourcing is contingent on managerial risk taking, which is partly determined by organizational context. Our results suggest that, in general, management stockholdings, firm risk orientation, and slack resource availability moderate the extent to which the perceived threat of opportunism, the threat of commercial failure, and opportunity for sustainable advantage all influence firm boundaries.</p>
            <p>We drew upon strategic management theory, organizational behavior theory, organization theory, and entrepreneurship models to form an integrated model of venture growth including 17 concepts from five micro and macro research domains. The model was tested with responses from 307 companies from the architectural woodworking industry. CEOs' specific competencies and motivations and firm competitive strategies were direct predictors of venture growth. CEOs' traits and general competencies and the environment had significant indirect effects.</p>
            <p>An organizational simulation (n = 85) and a field study (41 supervisors and 220 subordinates) were conducted to investigate the impact of subordinates' disability status on leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships. Both studies investigated how subordinate disability and ingratiation were related to LMX quality. As hypothesized, the interaction of disability and ingratiation affected LMX. Ingratiation had a stronger relationship to supervisors' LMX ratings when a subordinate had a disability. Implications of the results are discussed and suggestions for future research presented.</p>
            <p>A field study involving 190 employees in 38 work groups representing five diverse organizations provided evidence that social networks, as defined in terms of both positive and negative relations, are related to both individual and group performance. As hypothesized, individual job performance was positively related to centrality in advice networks and negatively related to centrality in hindrance networks composed of relationships tending to thwart task behaviors. Hindrance network density was significantly and negatively related to group performance.</p>
            <p>
            <p>This study examined the effects of goal difficulty, monetary incentives, and efficacy on the strategic risk, tactical implementation, and performance of teams performing a computer simulation. Goal difficulty increased strategic risk, in part through team efficacy. Strategic risk partially mediated goal difficulty's effect on performance. Incentives reduced strategic risk for easy-goal teams and improved tactical implementation. Teams with both difficult goals and incentives achieved the highest performance. Team performance was positively affected by goal difficulty, team efficacy, strategic risk, and tactical implementation.</p>
            <p>Observers have long noted a considerable gap between organizational research findings and management practices. Although volumes have been written about the probable causes and consequences of this gap, surprisingly little empirical evidence exists concerning the various viewpoints. The articles in this forum provide data on the role of academic-practitioner relationships in both generating and disseminating knowledge across boundaries. The contributions of each article are summarized in light of recent theories of knowledge creation, and suggestions are made for increasing the value and relevance of future research to both academics and practitioners.</p>
            <p>Drawing from literature on knowledge transfer and cognition, we develop a theoretical model for conducting research that is useful to practitioners. We explore the potential of this model by examining the usefulness of a research project involving ten companies. Perceived usefulness is related to the extent that members' organization self-design activities are informed by research results and to the existence of forums where researchers and practitioners jointly interpret results. We discuss implications for organizational science.</p>
            <p>Qualitative and quantitative data from team development practitioners were used to examine the link between the science and the practice of team development. Differences between academic and full-time practitioners were found in the value placed on empirical knowledge sources. Familiarity with recent relevant literature was associated with better intervention outcomes, and practitioners who valued empirical outlets reported greater short-term success than those who did not. Suggestions for improving the integration of science and practice with teams are presented.</p>

            <p>
            <p>Cognitive and learning theories were used to develop a framework in which different knowledge representations prime recipients with different schemata and thereby differentially affect their decision making. We evaluated interpretive, general, and particular knowledge representations in a laboratory experiment with managers. The hypotheses received mixed support, with significant results indicating the importance of particular knowledge representations in managerial decision making and an intriguing role for interpretive knowledge representations.</p>
            <p>We present a case of academic-practitioner research collaboration to illuminate three potential determinants of the success of such cross-profession collaborations: collaborative team characteristics, collaboration environment characteristics, and collaboration processes. The case study, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative data, illustrates the possible influences of these determinants on research progress, research team functioning, and benefits to individual team members. We identify directions for further work and implications for effective academic-practitioner collaborations in management research.</p>
            <p>This cross-national study explores the relative contributions of academic and corporate research to subsequent industrial R&amp;D activities within one industry. Japanese university research emerged as less influential than Japanese corporate research. The difference between the relevance of U.S. university and U.S. corporate research was only marginally significant. In both countries, university research appeared to contribute most to domestic firms. These findings accentuate the role that national institutional structures play in influencing a country's university research activity.</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes the contextual cues female managers attend to when considering raising gender-equity issues at work. Study 1 provides a qualitative look at the range of cues indicating context favorability, including demographic patterns, top-management qualities, and cultural exclusivity. Study 2 experimentally manipulates these cues and reveals that the exclusiveness of organizational culture is the most potent cue affecting willingness to sell a gender-equity issue. A discussion of mediators sheds lights on why cultural exclusivity affects issue selling.</p>
            <p>Recent perspectives have focused on the role of the firm in the generation and use of knowledge. These perspectives suggest that, while knowledge is "owned" at the individual level, the integration of this knowledge to a collective level is necessary. This integration of knowledge typically takes place in groups. In our experimental study, we examine how individuals in groups engage in micro-level interactions to effectively integrate knowledge by examining the effects of using three formal interventions: Information Sharing, Questioning Others, and Managing Time. In particular, we observe that simple formal interventions can improve knowledge integration when they lead to "windows of opportunity" for group members to consider ways to improve their work process that go beyond the formal intervention instructions. The most effective groups used these formal interventions to focus their attention into organized clusters of activity, during which they significantly changed their work process and improved their subsequent knowledge integration. In particular, groups in the Questioning Others and Managing Time conditions exhibited greater knowledge integration than groups in the Information Sharing and Control conditions. Groups with high-knowledge integration paced their attention to both adaptive improvements to their process and task execution. Overall, this study identifies simple structures, interruptions, and time pacing as central to the emerging concept of group flexibility by which members enhance their performance on novel and/or ambiguous tasks. We note links to complexity theory and knowledge-based thinking as well.</p>
            <p>Theories on the motivation underlying firm boundaries have recently sparked renewed debate. What best explains whether a firm relies on market control or hierarchical control to secure required resources? How do the characteristics of the resources come into play? In this study, we consider a comprehensive path model of the governance mode decision for sourcing technological know-how. By integrating different perspectives on firm boundaries, including transaction cost economics, a resource-based view, and an options perspective, we link characteristics of the technology (i.e., uniqueness, barriers to imitation, commercial uncertainty, technological dynamism) to the perceived threat of opportunism, the potential for sustainable advantage, and the pursuit of a licensing agreement vis-√†-vis the outright acquisition of the firm that possesses the desired know-how. We use structural equation modeling to analyze 127 sourcing arrangements. Our results show that technological dynamism and barriers to imitation indirectly influence the governance mode decision by increasing the perceived threat of opportunism. Commercial uncertainty directly influences the governance mode and decreases the likelihood of an acquisition vis-√†-vis a licensing agreement. Although uniqueness and barriers to imitation are also positively associated with the perceived potential for sustainable advantage, the potential for sustainable advantage had no direct effect on governance mode. Implications and suggestions for further research are offered.</p>
            <p>Successful application of concurrent development processes (concurrent engineering) requires tight coordination. To speed development, tasks often proceed in parallel by relying on preliminary information from other tasks, information that has not yet been finalized. This frequently causes substantial rework using as much as 50% of total engineering capacity. Previous studies have either described coordination as a complex social process, or have focused on the frequency, but not the content, of information exchanges. Through extensive fieldwork in a high-end German automotive manufacturer, we develop a framework of preliminary information that distinguishes information precision and information stability. Information precision refers to the accuracy of the information exchanged. Information stability defines the likelihood of changing a piece of information later in the process. This definition of preliminary information allows us to develop a time-dependent model for managing interdependent tasks, producing two alternative strategies: iterative and set-based coordination. We discuss the trade-offs in choosing a coordination strategy and how they change over time. This allows an organization to match its problem-solving strategy with the interdependence it faces. Set-based coordination requires an absence of ambiguity, and should be emphasized if either starvation costs or the cost of pursuing multiple design alternatives in parallel are low. Iterative coordination should be emphasized if the downstream task faces ambiguity, or if starvation costs are high and iteration (rework) costs are low.</p>
            <p>In this study, we explore seven in-depth cases of high-technology acquisitions and develop an empirically grounded model of technology and capability transfer during acquisition implementation. We assess how the nature of the acquired firms' knowledge-based resources, as well as multiple dimensions of acquisition implementation, have both independent and interactive effects on the successful appropriation of technologies and capabilities by the acquirer. Our inquiry contributes to the growing body of research examining the transfer of knowledge both between and within organizations. Propositions are developed to help guide further inquiry into the dynamics of acquisition implementation processes in general and, more specifically, the process of acquiring new technologies and capabilities from other firms.</p>
            <p>This study explores the premise that knowledge in new product development proves both a barrier to and a source of innovation. To understand the problematic nature of knowledge and the boundaries that result, an ethnographic study was used to understand how knowledge is structured differently across the four primary functions that are dependent on each other in the creation and production of a high-volume product. A pragmatic view of "knowledge in practice" is developed, describing knowledge as localized, embedded, and invested within a function and how, when working across functions, consequences often arise that generate problematic knowledge boundaries. The use of a boundary object is then described as a means of representing, learning about, and transforming knowledge to resolve the consequences that exist at a given boundary. Finally, this pragmatic view of knowledge and boundaries is proposed as a framework to revisit the differentiation and integration of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Through two exploratory studies, we develop and test an introductory framework of "organizational disidentification." Our first study explores the concept of organizational disidentification through a qualitative investigation of cognitive relationships with the National Rifle Association (NRA). Findings suggest that organizational disidentification is a self-perception based on: (1) a cognitive separation between one's identity and the organization's identity, and (2) a negative relational categorization of oneself and the organization (e.g., categorizations such as "rivals" or "enemies"). Organizational disidentification appears to be motivated by individuals' desires to both affirm positive distinctiveness and avoid negative distinctiveness by distancing themselves from incongruent values and negative stereotypes attributed to an organization. Our findings also suggest that organizational disidentification can lead individuals to take action (either volunteer work or voicing their opinion) as a result of their perceived separation from the organization's identity. Results of our second study-a large-scale survey of public attitudes about the NRA-provide support for this framework.</p>
            <p>This paper builds on prior theory and research on attention and identity to examine whether and how industries publicly attend to external events. Events are critical triggers of institutional transformation and industry evolution. However, they must first become the focus of public attention to have this effect. We draw on a paired case comparison of media coverage of eight nonroutine events affecting the natural environment and the U.S. chemical industry. We employ both deductive and inductive analysis to develop a model and hypotheses to explain two research questions. First, what determines the initial public attention to an event? Second, when and why do certain events attain high and sustained levels of industry attention? A key inference is that whether an event receives industry-level attention depends on either outsiders holding the industry accountable for the event, or insiders' internal concerns with the industry image. We further infer that an event can be transformed into a critical issue for an industry, warranting sustained attention, if there is contestation with outsiders over the accountability for the event and its enactment, and internal contradictions and challenges to the industry's identity.</p>
            <p>An extensive body of literature indicates the importance of teamwork to the success of innovative projects. This growing awareness, that "good teamwork" increases the success of innovative projects, raises new questions: What is teamwork, and how can it be measured? Why and how is teamwork related to the success of innovative projects? How strong is the relationship between teamwork and various measures of project success such as performance or team member satisfaction? This article develops a comprehensive concept of the collaboration in teams, called Teamwork Quality (TWQ). The six facets of the TWQ construct, i.e., communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion, are specified. Hypotheses regarding the relationship between TWQ and project success are tested using data from 575 team members, team leaders, and managers of 145 German software teams. The results of the structural equation models estimated show that TWQ (as rated by team members) is significantly associated with team performance as rated by team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. However, the magnitude of the relationship between TWQ and team performance varies by the perspective of the performance rater, i.e., manager vs. team leader vs. team members. Furthermore, TWQ shows a strong association with team members' personal success (i.e., work satisfaction and learning).</p>
            <p>Numerous researchers from various disciplines seem to agree that trust has a number of important benefits for organizations, although they have not necessarily come to agreement on how these benefits occur. In this article, we explore two fundamentally different models that describe how trust might have positive effects on attitudes, perceptions, behaviors, and performance outcomes within organizational settings. In the first section of the article, we examine the model that has dominated the literature: Trust results in direct (main) effects on a variety of outcomes. In the second section of the article we develop an alternative model: Trust facilitates or hinders (i.e., moderates) the effects of other determinants on attitudinal, perceptual, behavioral and performance outcomes via two distinct perceptual processes. Lastly, we discuss the conditions under which each of the models is most likely to be applicable. The theory is supplemented with a review of empirical studies spanning 40 years regarding the consequences of trust in organizational settings. The theoretical framework presented in this article provides insight into the processes through which trust affects organizational outcomes, provides guidance to researchers for more accurately assessing the impact of trust, provides a framework for better understanding past research on the consequences of trust, and suggests ways that organizational settings can be modified to capitalize on high levels of trust or mitigate the effects of low levels of trust.</p>
            <p>There is a rich debate in organizational theory about the contribution of supervisors to group process and performance, and about the span of control needed to make that contribution. In this paper, I summarize the debate and develop competing hypotheses. These competing hypotheses are tested using multisite survey and archival measures, and interpreted using qualitative data from the same study. I find that small supervisory spans improve performance through their positive effects on group process. In particular, supervisors with smaller spans achieved higher levels of relational coordination among their direct reports. Qualitative data suggest that supervisors with smaller spans achieved these results through working with, and providing intensive coaching and feedback to their direct reports.</p>
            <p>How are decision practices fostered in organizations and how are they linked to decision outcomes? This study addresses these questions by examining one financial institution's efforts to standardize and control decision making across geographically separated organizational units. We argue that decision-maker behavior is situated and is not simply a function of individual choice. Rather, in organizational settings decision-makers are subject to a hierarchy of influences that affect the decision processes they use and their resulting decision choices. To test our ideas, we examined 900 borrower "risk rating" decisions and found general support for our hypotheses. Decision makers were more likely to use the prescribed practice when decisions were important, when the decision target was known, and when the decision maker was located in a larger subunit. Decision makers altered their decision practices in the short term, but in the long term they appeared to partially revert to their earlier practices. Reliance on prescribed practice fostered stability in decisions, but surprisingly appeared to negatively affect future judgments. The findings indicate that organizations can change the more microaspects of decision making, but these changes may be transitory. Moreover the results suggest that decision makers may become complacent when they rely on prescribed decision practices, a tendency that can have untoward consequences for the organizations in which they are embedded.</p>
            <p>We argue that the debate regarding the performance implications of demographic diversity can be usefully reframed in terms of the network variables that reflect distinct forms of social capital. Scholars who are pessimistic about the performance of diverse teams base their view on the hypothesis that decreased network density-the average strength of the relationship among team members-lowers a team's capacity for coordination. The optimistic view is founded on the hypothesis that teams that are characterized by high network heterogeneity, whereby relationships on the team cut across salient demographic boundaries, enjoy an enhanced learning capability. We test each of these hypotheses directly and thereby avoid the problematic assumption that they contradict one another. Our analysis of data on the social networks, organizational tenure, and productivity of 224 corporate R&amp;D teams indicates that both network variables help account for team productivity. These findings support a recasting of the diversity-performance debate in terms of the network processes that are more proximate to outcomes of interest.</p>
            <p>The history of management practice is filled with innovations that failed to live up to the promise suggested by their early success. A paradox currently facing organizational theory is that the failure of these innovations often cannot be attributed to an intrinsic lack of efficacy. To resolve this paradox, in this paper I study the process of innovation implementation. Working from existing theoretical frameworks, I synthesize a model that describes the process through which participants in an organization develop commitment to using a newly adopted innovation. I then translate that framework into a formal model and analyze it using computer simulation. The analysis suggests three new constructs-reversion, regeneration, and the motivation threshold-characterizing the dynamics of implementation. Taken together, the constructs provide an internally consistent theory of how seemingly rational decision rules can create the apparent paradox of innovations that generate early results but fail to produce sustained benefit.</p>
            <p>This paper considers the role of team learning in organizational learning. I propose that a group-level perspective provides new insight into how organizational learning is impeded, hindering effective change in response to external pressures. In contrast to previous theoretical perspectives, I suggest that organizational learning is local, interpersonal, and variegated. I present data from an exploratory study of learning processes in 12 organizational teams engaged in activities ranging from strategic planning to hands-on manufacturing of products. These qualitative data are used to investigate two components of the collective learning process-reflection to gain insight and action to produce change-and to explore how teams allow an organization to engage in both radical and incremental learning, as needed in a changing and competitive environment. I find that team members' perceptions of power and interpersonal risk affect the quality of team reflection, which has implications for their team's and their organization's ability to change.</p>
            <p>Are multinational corporations (MNCs) superior to strategic alliances and markets in facilitating the flow of knowledge across borders? If so, what are the sources of this superiority? Despite their central importance to the theory and practice of international management, these questions have not been directly tested. Our paper seeks to address this gap in empirical research. Drawing upon recent research on multinational corporations and the knowledge-based view of the firm, we develop hypotheses regarding the relative superiority of alternative institutional arrangements as regards cross-border knowledge building. Analysis of patent citations by semiconductor companies points to the superiority of multinational firms over both alliances and markets in cross-border knowledge building. Interviews with engineers and managers in MNCs point to the intertwining of codified and tacit knowledge and; therefore, the need for both formal and informal mechanisms for successful knowledge building. Our findings suggest that the superiority of MNCs stems from the firms' ability to use multiple mechanisms of knowledge transfer flexibly and simultaneously to move, integrate, and develop technical knowledge. Our research, therefore, suggests that the challenge of knowledge management for MNCs extends beyond the creation of international information systems, to the design of organizational structures, systems, and culture capable of supporting the flow of knowledge.</p>
            <p>A fundamental theme in comparative cross-country research is the convergence of organizational forms in diverse national settings. In this paper we examine a special instance of this theme: the pattern of diversification across industries. A common argument is that technical and market forces compel firms to adopt "coherent" strategies of diversification. This thesis implies that there should be a convergence in the patterns of interindustry diversification in all market-based economies. An institutional approach offers an alternative view. From this perspective, when diversification across industries is seen as subject to nation-specific governance and resource constraints, countries should vary widely in their interindustry diversification patterns. To test these alternative views, we analyze the diversification patterns of large corporations from five countries: France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our results do not support the hypothesis of a common pattern of diversification across countries, and thus reject the technological thesis. By comparing two case studies in which entrepreneurs attempted to diversify by acquisition in France and the United States, we examine how institutions and agents interact to permit different diversification patterns to arise in diverse national environments. The statistical results and case studies imply that, given the fixity of certain institutions, even if countries are subject to globalization, convergence in diversification patterns is not necessary. The results cast doubt upon the merits of stylizing the debate as a choice between technical and institutional theories of organizational choice. Rather, the study points to the importance of two theoretical statements. The first is to inquire under what conditions there is likely to be consensus on a given "means-end" rationality for a specific managerial decision (e.g., diversification). The second is to understand the structural opportunities available to entrepreneurs for diversifying through acquisitions. Iterating between these cognitive and structural considerations shifts the focus from the false debate between technological and institutional arguments to the study of entrepreneurship situated in historically given national environments.</p>
            <p>Drawing on a social network perspective of organizational coordination, this paper investigates the effectiveness of coordination mechanisms on knowledge sharing in intraorganizational networks that consist of both collaborative and competitive ties among organizational units. Internal knowledge sharing within a multiunit organization requires formal hierarchical structure and informal lateral relations as coordination mechanisms. Using sociometric techniques, this paper analyzes how formal hierarchical structure and informal lateral relations influence knowledge sharing and how interunit competition moderates the association between such coordination mechanisms and knowledge sharing in a large, multiunit company. Results show that formal hierarchical structure, in the form of centralization, has a significant negative effect on knowledge sharing, and informal lateral relations, in the form of social interaction, have a significant positive effect on knowledge sharing among units that compete with each other for market share, but not among units that compete with each other for internal resources.</p>
            <p>This study explores the role information technology (IT) plays in organizational downsizing by studying two medium-sized American cities over a period of 10 years (1985-1995). Data were collected through 73 interviews, a questionnaire, and numerous documents. Four main findings emerged from the case studies. First, IT was found to facilitate organizational downsizing, but not to cause it. New City invested heavily in state-of-the-art IT over the years and more successfully downsized the organization than Old City, which lagged behind in IT investment and made no serious attempts to use IT as a tool to support strategic actions. Second, adverse environmental conditions triggered downsizing in both cities and determined the change strategies that managers used. When environmental pressures were mild (1985-1990), managers favored a convergent change strategy that resulted in limited downsizing efforts and small personnel reductions. In contrast, when environmental pressures were strong (1990-1995), managers of both cities engaged in strategic reorientation and in downsizing efforts that led to larger personnel reductions. Third, the role IT played in organizational downsizing varied according to the change strategy. IT was used to facilitate work redesign in a convergent change strategy and to facilitate more significant structural and work redesign in strategic reorientation. Fourth, more integrated and better use of IT allowed managers of New City to downsize more rationally and efficiently. It facilitated the transfer of personnel within departments, from middle management to the operations level, and across departments, from internally oriented to customer-oriented personnel. In doing so, managers of New City minimized operating costs while maintaining the same level of services. In contrast, IT in Old City did not facilitate such an agenda and managers downsized more superficially across the board, in all departments. Differences in IT consequences in the two cities are explained using the theory of slack resources in organizations.</p>
            <p>Organizations are evolving from the bureaucratic form based upon hierarchy to the new-form or radix organization that has the value chain as its relatively fluid foundation. This article explores the relationship between the radix organization and leadership, viewed through an organization-environment coevolution framework. It explicates the changes in the leader's role-sets and relationships brought about with the evolution from bureaucracy to the radix organization, developing a model of leadership that is referred to as the stakeholder model of organizational leadership. Stakeholder theory provides the appropriate theoretical basis for this model, as it offers the flexibility to accommodate various leader relationships. The stakeholder model of organizational leadership helps to predict leader effectiveness in organizations characterized by fuzzy organizational boundaries, flattened hierarchies, and work relationships sometimes brought about through contracts instead of employment.</p>
            <p>Individuals and social systems are often portrayed as risk averse and resistant to change. Such propensities are characteristically attributed to individual, organizational, and cultural traits such as risk aversion, uncertainty-avoidance, discounting, and an unwillingness to change. This paper explores an alternative interpretation of such phenomena. We show how the reproduction of successful actions inherent in adaptive processes, such as learning and competitive selection and reproduction, results in a bias against alternatives that initially may appear to be worse than they actually are. In particular, learning and selection are biased against both risky and novel alternatives. Because the biases are products of the tendency to reproduce success that is inherent in the sequential sampling of adaptation, they are reduced whenever the reproduction of success is attenuated. In particular, when adaptation is slowed, made imprecise, or recalled less reliably, the propensity to engage in risky and new activities is increased. These protections against the error of rejecting potentially good alternatives on inadequate experiential evidence are costly, however. They increase the likelihood of persisting with alternatives that are poor in the long run as well as in the short run.</p>
            <p>When organizations make important changes, such as introducing products based on new technologies, they may gain strategic advantages but they also experience disruptions. We argue that these disruptions are especially strong when organizations introduce multiple products simultaneously, leading to a temporary increase in the hazard of organizational failure. To test this hypothesis, we study the effects of new product introduction on the survival of U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. We find that having a large number of products-especially innovative products-lowers organizational mortality rates, but that mortality rates increase because of the simultaneous introduction of multiple products. This hazard is substantial, amounting to an increase in the market exit rate of over 40% for the "average" case of simultaneous product innovation. These results are robust in models that control for a wide variety of other factors. Our findings call into question the idea that organizations can overcome disruptions from structural inertia by introducing multiple products simultaneously.</p>
            <p>This multi-method field study examines the relative effects of two kinds of leader behaviors-design choices and hands-on coaching-on the effectiveness of self-managing teams. Findings show that how leaders design their teams and the quality of their hands-on coaching both influence team self-management, the quality of member relationships, and member satisfaction, but only leaders' design activities affect team task performance. Moreover, design and coaching interact, so that well-designed teams are helped more by effective coaching-and undermined less by ineffective coaching-than are poorly designed teams.</p>
            <p>This paper reports the results of experiments which examine attributions of leadership quality. Subjects played an abstract coordination game which is like many organizational problems. Previous research showed that when larger groups play the game, they rarely coordinate on the Pareto-optimal (efficient) outcome, but small groups almost always coordinate on the efficient outcome. After two or three periods of playing the game, one subject who was randomly selected from among the participants to be the "leader" for the experiment was instructed to make a speech exhorting others to choose the efficient action. Based on previous studies, we predicted that small groups would succeed in achieving efficiency but that large groups would fail. Based on social psychological studies of the fundamental attribution error, we predicted that the subjects would underestimate the strength of the situational effect (group size) and attribute cause to personal traits of the leaders instead-leaders would be credited for the success of the small groups, and blamed for the failure of the large groups. This hypothesis proved true: Subjects attributed differences in outcomes between conditions to differences in the effectiveness of leaders. In a second experiment, subjects voted to replace the leaders more frequently in the large-group condition (at a small cost to themselves), showing that misattributions of leadership ability also affect actual behavior by subjects. Previous research has demonstrated a tendency to credit or blame leaders for unusual performance. The difference in our study is that subjects should be blaming a structural condition-the size of the group-but they blame the leaders instead. Thus, our experiment is the first to establish a mistaken illusion of leadership.</p>
            <p>The concept of strategic surprise has been used by writers on military strategy to explore the successful amplification of resources during battle. This paper applies the same concept to subcontracting relationships and develops a cognitive framework to explain the phenomenon of strategic surprises, using buyer-supplier relations as an example. We first examine the factors that produce vulnerability to strategic surprise in cooperative situations. Then, we explore the reasons why firms are caught by surprise in spite of their vigilance. We present a model representing false alarms and strategic surprises as judgmental errors. We argue that judgmental errors cause misinterpretation of evidence and a consequent sense of false security. Interactive norms, which exist in some industries and may be taken as proxies for enduring relationships, may increase the likelihood of misjudgment and strategic surprises.</p>
            <p>This study describes the image of organizing that underlies a complex organization's ability to incorporate streams of innovation with continuing operations. I argue that a mechanistic organization archetype prevents people from seeing in their minds' eyes-from imagining-how to do the work of innovation organizationwide, but that theorists have failed to articulate an alternative to this archetype in its own terms. The study focuses on two elements of organizing: the differentiation and the integration of work. I build grounded theory for an alternate, innovative archetype of organizing by exploring the shared image of work differentiation and integration in twelve firms that vary in innovative ability. I find a fundamentally different image in innovative organizations that is centered on hands-on practice: People understand value creation as a long-term working relationship with customers, in which they apply the firm's skills to anticipate and solve customer problems. This practice is differentiated into distinct problems in value creation, each of which embodies the integral flow of work like a lateral slice, but which situates those problems in their own contexts. People understand themselves to be organized in an autonomous community of practice that takes charge of one of the problems. The communities of practice are integrated by standards for action: vivid, simple representations of value that frame work and that are reenacted in practice. The analysis details this different image of organizing by describing four autonomous communities of practice and contrasting them with the image of organizing found in noninnovative firms. The paper illustrates how this new image straight-forwardly organizes and controls innovative work, and how the noninnovative image of differentiation and integration makes this work unimaginable. I conclude that innovation can be incorporated with continuing operations, provided that managers and theorists reimagine the differentiation and integration of work. I offer preliminary ideas for doing so, and suggest some next steps in this research stream.</p>
            <p>This study examines how historical resource endowments and competencies affect strategic change and its outcomes amid environmental turbulence. Drawing from both behavioral and economics-based literatures, we develop four distinct perspectives regarding the likely effect of resources on strategic change. These four perspectives offer alternative predictions about how and why resource endowments should affect the likelihood or magnitude of strategic change, and how and why they should moderate the relation between strategic change and performance. We examine the predictive power of these four alternative arguments using extensive longitudinal data from a single industry context characterized both by substantial resource heterogeneity and environmental turbulence. Results indicate that organizations possessing greater stocks of historically valuable resources were much less likely to engage in adaptive strategic change, but also that this resource-driven disinclination towards change tended to have a benign or even beneficial effect on performance. We discuss the implications of our theory and findings for the strategic change literature and also for the literature on the resource-based view of the firm.</p>
            <p>A central debate in organizational theory concerns how organizations evolve. There are two diametrically opposing viewpoints. Adaptation theories predict that change occurs as fluid organizations adjust to meet shifting environmental demands, while selection theories predict that change occurs through the differential selection and replacement of inert organizations as environmental demands vary over time. Our paper bridges these polar opposites by using a punctuated equilibrium framework to examine organizations' responses to discontinuous industry-level change. This framework recognizes that the histories of many industries are occasionally punctuated by dramatic exogenous shocks, such as radical technological innovation, social and political turmoil, major changes in government regulation, and economic crashes. Our central thesis is that such environmental punctuations dramatically reduce pressures and rewards for organizational inertia and thereby alter both organizations' propensities for change and their survival chances following change. We focus on one form of punctuation, major regulatory change, and study firms in two industries: general hospitals and savings and loan associations. For organizations in both industries, we examine three important outcomes: shifts in organizational domain, CEO succession, and changes in financial performance. Our analyses show that punctuational regulatory change prompts shifts in organizational domains and executive leadership. Additionally, post-punctuation domain change and post-punctuation CEO succession both affect subsequent performance. We discuss our results in light of current thinking about the content and process effects of core organizational change, which has been developed in the context of stable environments. Finally, we argue for the development of more temporally sensitive theories of organizational action.</p>
            <p>The complexity of a firm's strategy affects both the ease with which the firm can replicate the strategy in a new setting and the ease with which rivals can imitate it. Simple strategies are as readily imitated as replicated, and highly intricate strategies resist imitation and replication equally. At moderate levels of complexity, however, a wedge develops between the ease of replication and the difficulty of imitation, so long as the replicator has better information than the imitator about the original success. An agent-based simulation model clarifies the structural reasons that this is so. The model also shows how the wedge-maximizing level of complexity varies with the replicator's informational edge over the imitator. The results help to pinpoint situations in which strategies requiring replication are likely to defy imitation and generate sustained competitive advantage. More generally, the analysis sheds light on the value of superior but imperfect information about good solutions to hard problems. Finally, the results suggest that a pattern long observed by organization scholars-that "loosely coupled organizations" are especially effective competitors-may arise for a very different reason than is normally posited.</p>
            <p>This paper develops and tests a theory of the historical contingency of the risk of acquisition using data from the higher education publishing market from 1958-1990. Interviews and historical analyses are combined to identify two forms of capitalism-personal and market, and in particular to publishing, to identify the institutional logics identified with each form of capitalism (an editorial and a market logic). Hazard-rate models are used to test for differences in the effects of these two logics on the organization and market determinants of acquisition. Publishers with relational network forms of organization in production and distribution were at a higher risk of acquisition in the market period but not in the editorial period. Competition in the product market increased the risk of acquisition in the market period, but not the editorial period. The covariates explaining the risk of acquisition change as a consequence of the evolution of capitalism and as a result of a firm's strategic and structural conformity with the institutional logic of the prevailing form of capitalism.</p>
            <p>This study seeks to expand our understanding of interorganizational emulation decisions made by top administrators in a broad sample of American colleges and universities. We analyze their emulation choices and show that these decision makers tend to emulate universities similar to their own. Our findings suggest, however, that the choice of emulation target within one's industry is not simply a matter of choosing the most structurally similar organization, but rather that identity-related attributes, such as reputation, organizational image, and organizational identity, also play a significant role in the emulation decision. The data also show that industry subgroups based on emulation decisions (strategic reference groups) differ in both structural and identity-related attributes. Further, interorganizational emulation decisions based on tactics of upward comparison (e.g., emulating universities with better reputations) are associated with greater strategic change, while downward comparisons are associated with greater perceived external threat. Finally, the data show that top management's perceptions of the university's level of environmental threat are related to their choice of a more coarse-grained or fine-grained set of attributes when determining the emulation target. We discuss some of these findings' implications for theory and practice.</p>
            <p>Strategic learning aims to generate learning in support of future strategic initiatives that will, in turn, foster knowledge asymmetries that can lead to differences in organizational performance. From a case study of a unique organization whose purpose is to facilitate strategic knowledge distillation, it was found that this process is characterized by targeted information gathering that relies on diverse experts for interpretation as well as validation. It also embodies the organizational capability to leverage information technologies in the distillation effort, integrating them with processes for generating, storing, and transporting rich, de-embedded knowledge across multiple levels of the organization. As a result of the case study, a model of the strategic learning is developed and a series of propositions regarding its context and processes are presented based on this model. The model highlights key dimensions of strategic learning that suggest design parameters for organizations building strategic learning systems.</p>
            <p>This paper proposes that maintaining "mutual knowledge" is a central problem of geographically dispersed collaboration and traces the consequences of failure to do so. It presents a model of these processes which is grounded in study of thirteen geographically dispersed teams. Five types of problems constituting failures of mutual knowledge are identified: failure to communicate and retain contextual information, unevenly distributed information, difficulty communicating and understanding the salience of information, differences in speed of access to information, and difficulty interpreting the meaning of silence. The frequency of occurrence and severity of each problem in the teams are analyzed. Attribution theory, the concept of cognitive load, and feedback dynamics are harnessed to explain how dispersed partners are likely to interpret failures of mutual knowledge and the consequences of these interpretations for the integrity of the effort. In particular, it is suggested that unrecognized differences in the situations, contexts, and constraints of dispersed collaborators constitute "hidden profiles" that can increase the likelihood of dispositional rather than situational attribution, with consequences for cohesion and learning. Moderators and accelerators of these dynamics are identified, and implications for both dispersed and collocated collaboration are discussed.</p>
            <p>This paper examines how a collaborative effort between the private and public sectors, called the Derivatives Policy Group (DPG), helped shape current regulation of financial innovation. In 1994 and 1995, this group of six large financial firms developed procedures for risk management, internal controls, and reporting for largely unregulated areas of finance, in cooperation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The process succeeded despite strong competition among the firms themselves and incentives for both the public and private sectors to resort to adversarial lobbying and legal challenges. The Derivatives Policy Group was a path-setting event in the development of flexible regulation of financial innovation that is now the norm for related policy making. The case is important in and of itself-the financial markets are a major concern of national and international economic policy-but here we treat it as an instance of a larger class of problems. Organizational science constantly encounters settings that involve numerous participants who compete or have histories of conflicts; who are interdependent, and collectively would gain (and even individually gain long term) by cooperating rather than competing on an issue; who fall under different governance systems; and who try as a group to design rules and principles governing their behavior. Four factors appear repeatedly in the research on the success or failure of such arrangements. These are (1) the initial dispositions toward cooperation, (2) the extant issues and incentives, (3) leadership, and (4) the number and variety of organizations involved. This paper focuses on how these factors shaped the development and consequences of the Derivatives Policy Group, and the general implications of this process for interorganizational cooperation.</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the concept of knowledge networks to explain why some business units are able to benefit from knowledge residing in other parts of the company while others are not. The core premise of this concept is that a proper understanding of effective interunit knowledge sharing in a multiunit firm requires a joint consideration of relatedness in knowledge content among business units and the network of lateral interunit relations that enables task units to access related knowledge. Results from a study of 120 new product development projects in 41 business units of a large multiunit electronics company showed that project teams obtained more existing knowledge from other units and completed their projects faster to the extent that they had short interunit network paths to units that possessed related knowledge. In contrast, neither network connections nor extent of related knowledge alone explained the amount of knowledge obtained and project completion time. The results also showed a contingent effect of having direct interunit relations in knowledge networks: While established direct relations mitigated problems of transferring noncodified knowledge, they were harmful when the knowledge to be transferred was codified, because they were less needed but still involved maintenance costs. These findings suggest that research on knowledge transfers and synergies in multiunit firms should pursue new perspectives that combine the concepts of network connections and relatedness in knowledge content.</p>
            <p>In this paper, I outline a perspective on knowing in practice which highlights the essential role of human action in knowing how to get things done in complex organizational work. The perspective suggests that knowing is not a static embedded capability or stable disposition of actors, but rather an ongoing social accomplishment, constituted and reconstituted as actors engage the world in practice. In interpreting the findings of an empirical study conducted in a geographically dispersed high-tech organization, I suggest that the competence to do global product development is both collective and distributed, grounded in the everyday practices of organizational members. I conclude by discussing some of the research implications of a perspective on organizational knowing in practice.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the validity of knowledge as a contingency variable. Building on recent advances in thinking about the dimensions of knowledge assets (Winter 1987, Zander and Kogut 1995), we argue that such dimensions might have an important influence on organization structure. More specifically, we focus on two dimensions of knowledge-observability and system embeddedness-and their influence over the level of unit autonomy and interunit integration in an international network of R&amp;D units. Statistical analysis of questionnaire responses from 110 R&amp;D unit managers show strong association between the dimensions of knowledge and organization structure. It also indicates partial support for the "fit" hypothesis in contingency theory. The paper makes two important contributions to the knowledge management literature. First, we find support for the contingency logic, suggesting that effective organization design has to take into account the underlying characteristics of the firm's knowledge base. Second, we shed light on a relatively neglected dimension of knowledge that we call system embeddedness. This is the extent to which knowledge is a function of the social and physical system in which it exists. In the statistical analysis it emerges as a strong predictor of organization structure. Moreover, it also appears to be conceptually distinct from the tacit-articulate dimension that is normally emphasized. This allows us to speculate on four generic forms that a firm's knowledge might take, that we label integrated, isolated, opaque, and transparent. These are discussed using examples from the data.</p>
            <p>At times knowledge can be seen as the source of organizational innovation and change-at other times, however, it can be the very constraint on that change. This conflicted role offers insights into why the phenomenon of organizational knowledge has been interpreted by researchers in multiple and possibly conflicting ways. Some theories depict knowledge as an empirical phenomenon, residing in action and becoming "organizational" in the acquisition, diffusion, and replication of those actions throughout the organization. Others consider it a latent phenomenon, residing in the possibility for constructing novel organizational actions. This paper argues that while each of these qualities-empirical and latent-are intrinsic to knowledge in organizations, our understanding of organizational phenomena is essentially incomplete until the relationship between them is considered. Building on structuration theory, we propose a complementary perspective that views organizational knowledge as the product of an ongoing and recursive interaction between empirical and latent knowledge, between knowledge as action and knowledge as possibility. We ground this complementary model of knowledge in evidence from the field study of two firms whose innovation practices provide unique insights into how knowledge simultaneously enables and constrains behavior in organizations. We then discuss how a complementary perspective avoids the reification of knowledge by depicting it instead as an ongoing and social process and offers an alternative distinction between individual and collective knowledge.</p>
            <p>Where should the boundaries of knowledge between economic actors be located in order to maximize the efficiency of their interactions? In particular, what circumstances determine whether it makes sense for adjacent stages in the value chain to invest in the development of common understanding, and when does it make sense for them to operate in mutual ignorance? To address these questions, it is necessary to construct a kind of production function which takes different forms of knowledge-specialist capability and trans-specialist understanding-as inputs and relates them to problem-solving output. Using a simple model of product design as a template, it is possible to derive such a production function. One can then use its properties in conjunction with plausible assumptions about the cost of acquiring different kinds of knowledge to develop general principles that explain when efficiency requires costly learning across specialties and when it is better to allow specialties to operate in mutual ignorance of one another's domains. The derived production function, contrary to some intuition and previous literature, implies that specialist capability can substitute for knowledge shared across specialties. This result in turn implies that the nature of learning costs, rather than the shape of knowledge benefits, plays the predominant role in determining when mutual ignorance is a good idea. The analysis also helps resolve the following paradox: The economy depends for its efficiency upon a drastic separation of knowledge across individuals and organizational units, yet studies of product development find that greater knowledge commonality is associated with better firm performance. An implication of the substitutability of specialized and trans-specialty knowledge is that situations where learning across specialties is desirable seem relatively rare in the economy as a whole. These situations are disproportionately common, however, in those areas where important managerial activity takes place. A key role of management is to attend to the strategic, operational, and governance needs of these "islands of shared knowledge in a sea of mutual ignorance."</p>
            <p>Drawing on an empirical study on automakers' management of supplier involvement in product development in Japan, this paper shows that when the design of a component is outsourced to a supplier, how much automakers know about the component matters for them to gain a better outcome. While the actual tasks of designing and manufacturing components could be outsourced, automakers should retain the relevant knowledge to obtain better component design quality. The paper argues that knowledge partitioning should be distinguished from task partitioning, and provides some implications for the knowledge-based theory of the firm. The results indicate that effective pattern of knowledge partitioning differs by the nature of component development project in terms of technological newness. For regular projects, it is more important for the automaker to have a higher level of architectural knowledge (how to coordinate various components for a vehicle) than of component-specific knowledge, which is supposed to be provided by the supplier. However, when the project involves new technology for the supplier, it is important for the automaker to have a higher level of component-specific knowledge to solve unexplored engineering problems together with the supplier. In innovative projects, effective knowledge partitioning seems to demand some overlap between an automaker and a supplier, rather than efficient and clear-cut boundaries that are optimal for regular projects. Such "fluid" nature of knowledge boundaries contingent on the project types poses a challenge for firms seeking both technological leadership and efficiency in established products. Developing and maintaining knowledge about an outsourced component is by no means easy. When the actual design tasks are outsourced, automakers miss substantial opportunities to gain relevant knowledge through learning by doing. Also, obtained knowledge may be diffused among competitors through shared suppliers. Another problem for automakers is that component-specific knowledge is important for only limited cases (innovative projects). Even worse, component-specific knowledge has a trade off relationship with architectural knowledge. Such an inherent dilemma of managing knowledge, however, may provide some automakers with the opportunity to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Additional analysis shows that one automaker managed both types of knowledge better than others in a manner that deals effectively with the dilemma. Its organizational mechanisms include career development policies, extensive documentation of technological information, internal training programs, and incentive schemes. The difficulty in implementing those mechanisms in a consistent and complementary manner seems to explain why there was a significant variance among automakers in knowledge level, even when the actual tasks were carried out by a shared supplier.</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the mechanisms through which organizations develop dynamic capabilities, defined as routinized activities directed to the development and adaptation of operating routines. It addresses the role of (1) experience accumulation, (2) knowledge articulation, and (3) knowledge codification processes in the evolution of dynamic, as well as operational, routines. The argument is made that dynamic capabilities are shaped by the coevolution of these learning mechanisms. At any point in time, firms adopt a mix of learning behaviors constituted by a semiautomatic accumulation of experience and by deliberate investments in knowledge articulation and codification activities. The relative effectiveness of these capability-building mechanisms is analyzed here as contingent upon selected features of the task to be learned, such as its frequency, homogeneity, and degree of causal ambiguity. Testable hypotheses about these effects are derived. Somewhat counterintuitive implications of the analysis include the relatively superior effectiveness of highly deliberate learning processes such as knowledge codification at lower levels of frequency and homogeneity of the organizational task, in contrast with common managerial practice.</p>
            <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) has been touted as providing great opportunities for small businesses to compete and thrive. Concerns about trust have been identified as a barrier to such businesses' success. This research explores how consumers' initial trust judgments about organizations they encounter on the Web may be influenced by hypertext links from trusted websites and associations with the more trust-inducing traditional retail channel. This paper develops and tests a cognitive model of the trust transfer process, arguing that trust is transferred across hypertext links based on the perceived interaction and similarity of the linked organizations, and that institution-based trust is transferred from the traditional shopping channel to a Web-based organization based on evidence that the Web-based organization has a physical store. An experimental study shows that a hypertext link from one website to another increased the extent to which the linked organizations were perceived to have a business relationship and be similar, and these perceptions had a positive influence on trusting beliefs regarding the linked site. Associating with the physical shopping channel by showing a picture of a building on a website increased the extent to which subjects reported intention to buy from the site. The study provided empirical evidence that trusting beliefs regarding the website had a significant positive effect on intention to buy from it. This paper discusses further development of the trust transfer model based on the social perception literature and explores implications for future research.</p>
            <p>We test hypotheses asserting that reward structures-an omnipresent element of the work context-have a strong influence on interpersonal trust, and we explore the cognitive and behavioral routes through which the effects may occur. Specifically, we use attribution theory to identify several core processes including social perception (causal schemas), self-perception, and attributional biases (correspondence bias, suspicion effects, and preexisting expectations) that may explain trust development. A 3 (cooperative/competitive/mixed rewards) X 2 (high/low initial trust) experimental design in a problem-solving task was used to examine the hypotheses. The results suggest that reward structures have a strong influence on trust, and that the effect is mediated by causal schemas, suspicion effects, and self-perception. We also found some support for the prediction that the impact of mixed reward structures on trust is biased by individuals' preexisting expectations about their partner's trustworthiness. The theory and results suggest that attribution theory provides a useful framework for understanding the complex, diverse, and multiple routes through which trust may develop.</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the antecedents of intraorganizational trust and, more specifically, how the frequency of communication between trustor and trustee moderates the impact of these factors on perceived trustworthiness. Data on 157 dyadic relationships among 50 senior managers within a multinational corporation confirm that the effect of both trustor, as well as trustee characteristics on the level of perceived trustworthiness, is moderated by the frequency of communication between the two parties. As communication frequency increases, the trustor's general attitudinal predisposition towards peers becomes less important as a determinant of his/her evaluation of trustworthiness of other managers within the organization. In contrast, as communication frequency increases, the trustor's and trustee's contexts within the organization become more important determinants of perceived trustworthiness.</p>
            <p>It is generally assumed that improved outcomes accompany the use of trust as a governance mechanism in an interfirm relationship. Briefly, trust is a social lubricant that reduces the friction costs of existing trade and/or serves to increase the scope of trade. In contrast to this universalistic view, we posit that the performance of trust-based governance is contingent on the ability of trading partners to "read" each other and learn about counterpart behavior. These information-processing abilities allow firms to assess partner trustworthiness better, which reduces the risk of misplaced trust. The increased efficacy of communication and learning from one another also enables them to better capitalize from the adaptation and revision possibilities uncovered through trust-based governance during the task-execution phase. Given the central role of these cognitive requirements, we assess these contingent effects with data from a knowledge-intensive task setting. Using a sample of 129 firms that have engaged outside contractors on client-sponsored R&amp;D projects, we find strong support for our thesis. Specifically, we find that trust-based governance has a larger positive impact on task performance when the client is more skilled at understanding the outsourced tasks at hand, the task itself requires skills that are relatively more readily taught (less tacit), and the task itself is organized in parallel with work being done at the contractor as well as the client. As a corollary, we also find that firms adopt trust-based governance to a greater extent as these information-processing abilities increase, as well as with the colocation of the contractor and client. Suggestions for engineering trust-based governance are offered.</p>
            <p>In this paper we investigate the relationship between supplier trust in the buyer and transaction costs and information sharing in a sample of 344 supplier-automaker exchange relationships in the United States, Japan, and Korea. Our findings indicate that perceived trustworthiness reduces transaction costs and is correlated with greater information sharing in supplier-buyer relationships. Moreover, the findings suggest that the value created for transactors, in terms of lower transaction costs, may be substantial. In particular, we found that the least-trusted automaker spent significantly more of its face-to-face interaction time with suppliers on contracting and haggling when compared to the most trusted automaker. This translated into procurement (transaction) costs that were five times higher for the least trusted automaker. Finally, we argue that trust is unique as a governance mechanism because it not only minimizes transaction costs, but also has a mutually causal relationship with information sharing, which also creates value in the exchange relationship. Other governance mechanisms (e.g., contracts, financial hostages) are necessary costs incurred to prevent opportunistic behavior, but do not create value beyond transaction-cost minimization. Our findings provide empirical evidence that trustworthiness lowers transaction costs and may be an important source of competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>This paper contributes to the conceptual and empirical understanding of organizational trust. It confirms the importance of "contextual confidence" in institutions for building trust. Moreover, it extends models of trust production to include the effects of purposive action by the truster over and above the contextual prediction of trust emphasized in previous research. Accordingly, "active trust development" is conceptualized as a strategy to strengthen the basis for trust. Empirical evidence is drawn from a survey of 615 Hong Kong firms that manage operations in mainland China. Confidence in China's institutional context was found to have a strong positive association with trust in the local staff working within that context. Active trust development was validated as a means of enhancing trust, though its effect on trust was not as strong as that of perceived institutional effectiveness. Active trust development initiatives are particularly valuable in an environment such as contemporary China, where the institutional foundations for trust remain underdeveloped. The positive correlation of trust with organizational performance provides an incentive for managers to explore these initiatives. At the same time, government and other bodies in China and elsewhere, which are in a position to create and promote effective institutions, are encouraged to intensify their efforts in that direction.</p>
            <p>Competitiveness in global industries increasingly requires the ability to develop trusting relationships. This requires organizations, and the individuals they are comprised of, to be both trustworthy and trusting. An important question is whether societal culture influences the tendency of individuals and organizations to trust. Based largely on Yamagishi's (1994, 1998a, b) theories explaining trust, commitment, and in-group bias in collectivist cultures, this study examines potential differences in levels of trust between individualist and collectivist cultures. Survey data was collected from 1,282 mid-level managers from large banks in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, and the United States. We first study differences in how individuals from individualist and collectivist societies trust in-groups versus out-groups. This provides an important foundation for hypotheses regarding differences in individual propensities to trust and two measures of organizational trust: internal trust (trust within the organization) and external trust (an organization's trust for suppliers, customers, etc.). Findings show higher levels of propensity to trust and organizational external trust in the United States than in Asia.</p>
            <p>Although research on trust in an organizational context has advanced considerably in recent years, the literature has yet to produce a set of generalizable propositions that inform our understanding of the organization and coordination of work. We propose that conceptualizing trust as an organizing principle is a powerful way of integrating the diverse trust literature and distilling generalizable implications for how trust affects organizing. We develop the notion of trust as an organizing principle by specifying structuring and mobilizing as two sets of causal pathways through which trust influences several important properties of organizations. We further describe specific mechanisms within structuring and mobilizing that influence interaction patterns and organizational processes. The principal aim of the framework is to advance the literature by connecting the psychological and sociological micro-foundations of trust with the macro-bases of organizing. The paper concludes by demonstrating how the framework can be applied to yield novel insights into traditional views of organizations and to stimulate original and innovative avenues of organizational research that consider both the benefits and downsides of trust.</p>
            <p>This article asks a basic question of organizational evolution: When and where will a new organizational form emerge? Using a definition of organizational forms as external identity codes, we focus on two answers drawn from contemporary organization theory. The first holds that formal institutions such as industry associations and standard-setting bodies will result in a taken-for-granted organizational form. The second answer contends that increasing organizational density (number of organizations) will generate a legitimated organizational form. As reported here, a historical case study of the disk array market and its associated technologies finds both arguments limited. Although significant collective activity in association building and standard setting occurs among disk array producers, these have not yet led to an organizational form. Similarly, an observed trajectory of organizational density showing rapid growth followed by stabilization has not yet generated an organizational form. In our view, the diversity of origins and other activities of those organizations operating in this market work against institutionalization of the disk array organizational form. We reason that if firms in the market derive their primary identities from other activities (implying that there are few highly focused firms deriving their primary identity from disk arrays), then the disk array producer identity cannot cohere into a code or form. This conclusion suggests a respecification of the legitimation component of the density-dependent model of organizational evolution.</p>
            <p>The keiretsu structuring of assembler-supplier relations historically enabled Japanese auto assemblers to remain lean and flexible while enjoying a level of control over supply akin to that of vertical integration. Yet currently there is much talk of breakdowns in keiretsu networks. This paper examines some recent developments in Japanese parts-supply keiretsu. We argue that keiretsu relationships are drifting from "hybrid" or "network" (i.e., keiretsu) governance modes toward the extremes of arms-length contracting and top-down administration. These changes are best understood through a combination of transaction cost and learning perspectives on alliance. Consistent with transaction-cost economics, the shift in purchase-supply relationships can be traced to changes in the nature of parts transactions and keiretsu-governance structures. A learning perspective on alliance complements and extends transaction-cost theory, providing additional explanation of the sources of change and the specific governance choices being made. Our first two cases document a drift in Toyota's keiretsu supply network toward a hierarchical form in the management of parts-supply transactions. Toyota has effectively internalized its transactions with Daihatsu by taking a controlling interest. Toyota's strategy toward long-term partner Denso, on the other hand, was very different. Toyota built, from the ground up, an in-house capability in electronic components, thus scaling down its dependence on Denso. A third case considers a general trend in the Japanese auto industry toward greater standardization of parts. With the routinization of quality, reliability, and speed in supply management, the need for keiretsu-style governance has declined. The withering of keiretsu obligations is also traceable to globalization and the continuing weakness of the Japanese economy, which have prompted Japanese firms to question received business practice.</p>
            <p>It is difficult for the firm competing through information technology resources to gain a sustainable advantage because systems are easy to imitate and substitute resources are often available to competitors. The innovator may be unable to appropriate all of the benefits from information technology investments. Airlines have installed computerized reservations systems in travel agencies to appropriate the returns from their investments in information technology. The airlines expected to obtain a number of benefits from this strategy, including increased efficiency, possible bias in favor of the computerized reservations systems owner on the part of the travel agent, and fees from other airlines for making reservations for them. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the appropriation of value by computerized reservations systems owners from deploying systems in travel agencies. These benefits, beyond fees from travel agents, should be seen in the vendor airline's market share between cities and in the overall performance of the airline at an industry level. This paper models airline performance as a function of computerized reservations systems ownership at two levels: for selected city-pairs and at the overall level of the firm. The city-pair analysis employs a multinomial logit market share model that analyzes five years of data on 72 city-pair routes. The industry model uses longitudinal data for a panel of 10 airlines for 12 years. The results of both analyses support hypotheses that computerized reservations systems ownership is positively related to airline performance. It appears that strong airlines have appropriated the benefits of their computerized reservations systems, turning them into highly specialized assets for further travel-related innovation. This work offers useful theoretical extensions and methodological approaches for the study of similar kinds of network technology innovations that are currently being deployed in association with electronic commerce on the Internet.</p>
            <p>Replication, a familiar phenomenon sometimes referred to as the "McDonalds approach," entails the creation and operation of a large number of similar outlets that deliver a product or perform a service. Companies pursuing this strategy are now active in over 60 industries. Although replicators are becoming one of the dominant organizational forms of our time, they have been neglected by scholars interested in organizations. As a result of this neglect, replication is typically conceptualized as little more than the exploitation of a simple business formula. Such a view clouds the strategic subtlety of replication by side-stepping the exploration efforts to uncover and develop the best business model as well as the ongoing assessment that precedes large-scale replication of it. Empirical evidence supports an alternative view of replication strategy as a process that involves a regime of exploration in which the business model is created and refined, followed by a phase of exploitation in which the business model is stabilized and leveraged through large-scale replication. In this paper we present the key elements of a theory of replication strategy. We discuss key aspects of a replication strategy, namely the broad scope of knowledge transfer and the role of the central organization, and the analytical concepts of template and Arrow core as a preamble for specifying hypotheses about the conditions under which a replication strategy is more likely to succeed in a competitive setting. Replication strategy provides unusually transparent examples of the process of leveraging knowledge assets; we exploit this in our concluding discussion.</p>
            <p>Strategy research consists of a balance between positive and normative theory. Normative theories suggest particular heuristics, or cognitive representations, to find appropriate solutions. Heuristics permit faster solutions to real-time problems; they also suffer from the potential of negative transfer to inappropriate applications. The theory of real options provides the appropriate heuristic framing of competencies and exploratory search. A real options approach marries the theory of financial options to foundational ideas in strategy, organizational theory, and complex systems. We join these approaches to identify three pairs of concepts: scarce factor and the underlying asset in option theory, inertia and irreversibility, and the ruggedness of landscape and option values. Strategic theories of resources largely define a core competence as unique and nonimmutable. In doing so, this definition has wrongly forgotten Barney's initial insight into scarce factor markets as determining the valuation of a competitive asset. Financial theory of real options derives its heuristics of investing in exploratory search by inferring future value of today's investments from market prices. We apply the three conceptual pairs to the evaluation of capabilities as real options through a formal descriptive model. The valuation of core capabilities is derived from observing the price dynamics of correlated strategic factors in the market. Because of inertia, managers cannot easily adjust the wrong set of organizational capabilities to the emergence of market opportunities. However, firms that have made investments in capabilities appropriate to these opportunities are able to respond. From this description, we define core competence as the choice of capabilities that permits the firm to make the best response to market opportunities. The heuristic framing of capabilities as real options guides the normative evaluation of the balance between exploitation and exploration.</p>
            <p>This paper is about two managers of Red Cross refugee camps in Tanzania who manage by exception in rather exceptional circumstances. Using a model of managerial work that delineates roles carried out at the information, people, and action levels, inside and outside the unit, these managers' activities concentrate especially on communicating and controlling a chaotic situation in a steady state, at least temporarily. While many other managers appear to be moving away from conventional forms of managing-to more linking instead of leading and convincing instead of controlling, etc.-here are two managers who seem to be going the other way, precisely because their situation is so unconventionally risky. Ned Bowman's great contribution has been not just about risks and options per se, but in the risks that he himself took and the options that he himself exposed. In this spirit, the paper concludes with a plea for the opening up not simply of content, but of context.</p>
            <p>The real options approach is frequently advocated as an approach that offers a positive and radical reassessment of the value of risk and exploration. We examine a recent case where Merck used the real options approach to justify an investment in an R&amp;D project. This case is used to highlight some of the problems associated with using real options. We note that the assumptions incorporated in most standard option valuation models can conflict with the conclusions reached by strategic analysis. As a result, users of real options models should understand the quantitative aspects of these models, and may often need to create a customized model for each situation. The difficulty of developing customized models may explain, in part, the limited use of the real options approach in strategic analysis.</p>
            <p>Does owner management necessarily eliminate the agency costs of ownership? Drawing on agency literature and on the economic theory of the household, we argue that private ownership and owner management expose privately held, owner-managed firms to agency threats ignored by Jensen's and Meckling's (1976) agency model. Private ownership and owner management not only reduce the effectiveness of external control mechanisms, they also expose firms to a "self-control" problem created by incentives that cause owners to take actions which "harm themselves as well as those around them" (Jensen 1994, p. 43). Thus, shareholders have incentive to invest resources in curbing both managerial and owner opportunism. We extend this thesis to the domain of the family firm. After developing hypotheses which describe how family dynamics and, specifically, altruism, exacerbate agency problems experienced by these privately held, owner-managed firms, we use data obtained from a large-scale survey of family businesses to field test our hypotheses and find evidence which suggests support for our proposed theory. Finally, we discuss the implications of our theory for research on family and other types of privately held, owner-managed firms.</p>
            <p>The ability to integrate dispersed pockets of expertise and institute an organizational repository of knowledge is considered to be vital for sustained effectiveness in contemporary business environments. Information technologies provide cost-effective functionalities for building knowledge platforms through systematic acquisition, storage, and dissemination of organizational knowledge. However, in order to gain the value-adding potential of organizational knowledge, it is not sufficient to simply adopt and deploy IT-enabled knowledge platforms. These platforms must be assimilated into the ongoing work processes in organizations. Yet, theories of technology innovation and use suggest that a variety of institutional, social, and political factors blend together in influencing the extent to which complex information technologies are actually assimilated into organizational practice. Therefore, this research addresses a significant question: What forces influence the assimilation of knowledge platforms in organization? Given the significant gap between the adoption and actual assimilation of complex technologies into organizations, this is an important question. Empirical evidence is generated by examining the forces influencing the assimilation of CASE technologies in systems development projects in organizations. CASE is considered to be one of the most mature knowledge platforms in contemporary organizations. The empirical evidence sheds light on the role of institutional forces that influence the rate of assimilation of the technology. The findings have significant implications for further research and practice.</p>
            <p>Despite a long tradition of research on organizational mortality, organizational theorists have not examined the effect of incentive contracting on firm survival. This paper fills this gap by examining the effect of incentive contracting on the survival of U.S. business format franchise systems over the period 1984-1996. The paper finds empirical support for several hypotheses derived from efficient contracting theory. In general, large firms that adopt policies which screen agents, signal quality, and control agents' free-riding are more likely to survive than large firms which do not adopt these policies.</p>
            <p>International joint venture (IJV) research largely omits social and cognitive processes and, hence, overlooks their potentially important implications. This paper presents a four-year longitudinal investigation into the social identification and social enactment processes in a British-Italian, shared management joint venture. Using social identification and social enactment theories as conceptual anchors, the study reveals that national social identities were the dominant sense-making vehicle used by team members, although multiple sources of social identification were possible and present in this IJV. Contextual changes occurred that could be expected to favor organizational (IJV-based) social identities, but the dominant use of nationality-based identities did not change. Our findings suggest that social identity enactments (using particular boundaries to define primary social identities) by team members mediate the relationship of contextual variables, both environmental and structural, with group and organizational outcomes (such as role investment and job satisfaction). Our empirical results shed light on unresolved debates in the IJV literature, e.g., the implications of cultural distance and shared management for IJV performance. This study also contributes to social identity theory by highlighting promising directions for development of contextual and longitudinal dimensions in that research stream.</p>
            <p>Several prior articles have emphasized the importance of alignment between business and information system (IS) strategies, and between business and IS structures. Seeking to advance our understanding of alignment, we examine the dynamics of changes in alignment through strategy/ structure interactions in the business and IS domains. More specifically, we address the following question: In what ways does alignment evolve over time? Changes in the strategic IS management profile (which includes business strategy, IS strategy, business structure, and IS structure) over time are examined using a punctuated equilibrium model, involving long periods of relative stability, or evolutionary change, interrupted by short periods of quick and extensive, or revolutionary, change. Case studies of changes in business and IS strategies and structure over long time periods in three organizations suggest that the punctuated equilibrium model provides a valuable perspective for viewing these dynamics. The cases suggest that a pattern of alignment may continue over a long period, because either the level of alignment is high or the managers do not recognize the low alignment as a problem. Revolutions, involving changes in most or all dimensions of the strategic IS management profile, interrupt the evolutionary changes. However, organizations hesitate to make such revolutionary changes in strategic IS management profiles. Complete revolutions apparently require a combination of strong triggers. Finally, post-revolution adjustments to one dimension of the strategic IS management profile seem to follow revolutionary changes.</p>
            <p>While the recent focus on knowledge has undoubtedly benefited organizational studies, the literature still presents a sharply contrasting and even contradictory view of knowledge, which at times is described as "sticky" and at other times "leaky." This paper is written on the premise that there is more than a problem with metaphors at issue here, and more than accounts of different types of knowledge (such as "tacit" and "explicit") can readily explain. Rather, these contrary descriptions of knowledge reflect different, partial, and sometimes "balkanized" perspectives from which knowledge and organization are viewed. Taking the community of practice as a unifying unit of analysis for understanding knowledge in the firm, the paper suggests that often too much attention is paid to the idea of community, too little to the implications of practice. Practice, we suggest, creates epistemic differences among the communities within a firm, and the firm's advantage over the market lies in dynamically coordinating the knowledge produced by these communities despite such differences. In making this argument, we argue that analyses of systemic innovation should be extended to embrace all firms in a knowledge economy, not just the classically innovative. This extension will call for a transformation of conventional ideas coordination and of the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.</p>
            <p>Recent conceptualizations of trends in the structure of U.S. industry have focused on the relative importance of markets, hierarchies, and hybrid intermediate forms. This paper advances the discussion by distinguishing three ideal-typical forms of organization and their corresponding coordination mechanisms: market/price, hierarchy/authority, and community/trust. Different institutions combine the three forms/mechanisms in different proportions. Economic and organizational theory have shown that, compared to trust, price and authority are relatively ineffective means of dealing with knowledge-based assets. Therefore, as knowledge becomes increasingly important in our economy, we should expect high-trust institutional forms to proliferate. A review of trends in employment relations, interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust. There is also reason to believe that the form of trust most effective in this context is a distinctively modern kind-"reflective trust"-as opposed to traditionalistic, "blind" trust. Such a trend to reflective trust appears to threaten the privileges of currently dominant social actors, and these actors' resistance, in combination with the complex interdependencies between price, authority, and trust mechanisms, imparts a halting character to the trend. But the momentum of this trend nevertheless appears to be self-reinforcing, which suggests that it may ultimately challenge the foundations of our capitalist form of society while simultaneously creating the foundations of a new, postcapitalist form.</p>
            <p>Managers evaluate the organizational performance by comparing it with historical aspiration levels, and are more likely to make strategic changes when the performance falls below the aspiration level. Historical aspiration levels can be updated with different speed, because a focus on current performance will lead to quickly adjusting aspiration levels where historical performance has low weight, while a focus on past performance will lead to slowly adjusting performance levels where the current performance has low weight. A simulation model of aspiration-level learning and strategic change under uncertainty yields the following findings: (1) Slow adjustments of an aspiration level gives higher performance across different levels of environmental uncertainty, (2) slow adjustments of aspirations will dominate in populations with different adjustment levels if low-performing organizations are removed and replaced by organizations of the form currently performing best, and (3) stronger selection leads to faster domination by slow adjusters. Empirical analysis of format changes in radio stations finds slow adjustment of aspiration levels to be prevalent, and finds slower adjustment in competitive markets, as predicted.</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the perceived pattern of alignment between a manager's words and deeds, with special attention to promise keeping, and espoused and enacted values. It terms this perceived pattern of alignment "Behavioral Integrity." The literatures on trust, psychological contracts, and credibility combine to suggest important consequences for this perception, and literatures on hypocrisy, social accounts, social cognition, organizational change, and management fashions suggest key antecedents to it. The resulting conceptual model highlights an issue that is problematic in today's managerial environment, has important organizational outcomes, and is relatively unstudied.</p>
            <p>Drawing on work from transfer theory at the individual unit of analysis, this study examines positive and negative transfer effects in organization acquisitions. Data from 96 organizations reveal that, consistent with theories on positive transfer of industry knowledge, similar acquisitions are positively related to acquisition performance. In addition, consistent with theory on negative transfer of past acquisition knowledge, second acquisitions underperform first acquisitions, particularly when first and second targets are from different industries. In combination, these findings suggest that the routines and practices established in prior situations transfer to new situations, and that the effect of such transfer depends on the similarity of industrial environments.</p>
            <p>This study examines environmental and organizational factors that influence a multinational enterprise's (MNE's) capability exploitation and building in a complex foreign market. Analysis of data from 167 MNE subunits in the People's Republic of China suggests that capability exploitation and capability building are inversely associated with environmental complexity and industrial uncertainty. Business cultural specificity impedes capability exploitation but not capability building. While capability exploitation is associated with the use of wholly owned entry mode, capability building is linked to the joint venture mode. MNEs seeking local market expansion also deploy greater capability exploitation and building than those seeking export market growth. Our analysis further suggests that the threats of environmental hazards on capability building are reduced when the joint venture entry mode is used. An appropriate alignment of capability exploitation or building with its identified determinants is found to be associated with high performance.</p>
            <p>The purpose of stakeholder management is to facilitate our understanding of increasingly unpredictable external environments, thereby facilitating our ability to manage within these environments. We argue that a powerful implicit assumption within the stakeholder literature-that priorities within role-based stakeholder groups are relatively homogeneous-blurs our understanding of organization-stakeholder relationships. Two important and related areas of concern are presented. The first involves the primacy of role in stakeholder definition. This role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is appropriate if, for a particular issue, role-based stakeholder group members have similar priorities. Individual and collective self-interest provides a rationale for this assumption. However, an important problem with this approach arises in situations in which self-interest is not the primary motivator of individuals' priorities. In these instances, subgroups within different role-based stakeholder groups might have more similar priorities than either subgroup has with others within their role-based stakeholder group. In these situations the role primacy approach impedes, rather than facilitates, an understanding of our environment. Our second concern is related to insufficient rigor in the application of stakeholder analysis. Most stakeholder studies, both theoretical and empirical, fall short in the determination of relevant interests and the subsequent subdivision of role-based stakeholder groups into rigorously defined specific stakeholder groups. Having suggested that the role primacy approach to stakeholder definition is less than ideal, we examine the extent to which, and the conditions under which, roles are likely to determine priorities, and thus, the likelihood of relatively homogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups. In addition, we present an illustrative empirical analysis of stakeholder group priorities. The illustrative study is conducted within the context of intercollegiate athletics. Related literature and our empirical results indicate that role-based self-interest frequently is not a sufficient "binding tie" of stakeholder groups. Given this background, we present an alternative approach to stakeholder analysis that borrows heavily from the customer segmentation literature of marketing. Our alternative approach can accommodate heterogeneous priorities within role-based stakeholder groups.</p>
            <p>Competitive advantage is a key concept in strategic management research for a number of reasons-not the least of which is that an avowed consequence of its attainment is held to be superior economic performance. However, few prior empirical studies have directly and systematically documented the incidence or prevalence of persistent superior economic performance. The research reported here is based on empirical studies of a large number of industry samples for which longitudinal data were stratified by levels of performance using a new methodology and then analyzed in terms of their dynamics. This new stratification technique was used in lieu of autoregressive methods employed in prior studies of performance persistence to allow for a true outlier analysis because persistent superior economic performance both has been argued theoretically, and found empirically, to be rare. Detailed results from a sample of 6,772 firms in 40 industries over 25 years are presented to illustrate the findings that: (1) while some firms do exhibit superior economic performance, (2) only a very small minority do so, and (3) the phenomenon very rarely persists for long time frames. These results, while not providing direct support for a particular extant strategic management or economic theory concerning firm performance, are most consonant with the resource-based view of the firm and have implications for significant aspects of other received strategic management and economic theories.</p>
            <p>Adaptation to radical change is central to research in organization theory, and some of the most dramatic examples of environmental change have occurred recently in transition economies such as China. I take advantage of change during China's economic reform to study the relative importance of organizational and environmental factors in producing innovative managerial response. I find that strategic choice predicted innovation in the early stages of reform, but environmental factors increased in salience over time. Intrafirm support, Communist Party connections, and a market orientation produced innovation early in reform. Simple imitation of others was also salient in early years. As reform progressed, managers increasingly imitated other profitable firms and drew on their own experience. My results inform an understanding of both the process by which innovation occurs and firm behavior in transition economies.</p>
            <p>We empirically explore the legitimating accounts for and against policies precluding workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, focusing on how agents working at both the national level and within organizations use broader cultural accounts in building their legitimating accounts in local settings. The diffusion perspective in institutional theory has portrayed how agents import "ready-to-wear" cultural accounts. In contrast, translation theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in part on their messages becoming "autocommunicational," so that listeners identify themselves with the message.</p>
            <p>Interpersonal relationships can be fragile. The mere perception of opportunistic behavior can lead to a breakdown in cooperation. Once damaged, the question then arises as to whether and how cooperation might be restored. Noncooperative game theory raises serious doubts about the possibilities, although interactional justice and impression management research have shown that verbal explanations can dampen reactions to aversive behavior. Philosophical, anthropological, and ethological research all suggest that genuine forgiveness may require something more tangible and substantive than an explanation. Thus, the current experiment investigated the effects of explanations and varying forms of substantive amends on the restoration of mutual cooperation. The results confirm that rebuilding cooperation is feasible. Apologies and simple explanations can be effective to a degree, though substantive amends have significantly more positive effects than explanations alone. In contrast to prior findings on interactional justice, acknowledgments were more effective than denials in repairing short interactions. This research demonstrates that, once breached, cooperation can be reestablished and that actions as well as explanations and apologies can augment the process in important and sometimes subtle ways.</p>
            <p>Past literature using the resource-based view of the firm has concentrated on attributes of firms' capabilities and on strategies for exploiting existing firm-specific assets. Comparatively little research has been conducted on how a firm develops, manages, and deploys capabilities to support its business strategy. This study seeks to understand the process of capability development and to establish a model that has both theoretical and practical significance. A longitudinal case study of the electronic commerce strategy formation and implementation at Bolsa de Valores de Guayaquil, an Ecuadorian stock exchange, yielded qualitative data that allowed inductive modeling of the capability development process. The model reveals that capability development in support of a new strategy is a gradual process that is cumulative, expansive, and very dependent on the way that difficult-to-imitate resources and actions are combined. At Bolsa de Valores de Guayaquil, actions that supported the development of the firm's capability to strategize seem to have contributed the most in the initial phase of the strategy formation and implementation; actions that helped the development of the firm's capability to be flexible appear to have contributed the most during the middle phase; and actions that supported the development of the firm's capabilities to integrate and engender trust seem to have contributed the most in the final phase. In addition, the key resources that supported the overall capabilities development process included leadership, organizational culture, information technology, long-term view, and social networks. Implications of this model for both research and practice are discussed.</p>
            <p>A group's tendency to protect its identity often inhibits it from initiating radical change. For this reason, external interventions are typically needed to engage a group in reexamining and moving beyond its current identity. If threatened by these external interventions, however, identity beliefs can become emotionally heated and resistant to the cognitively rational efforts of outsiders. At the same time, the insider group's emotional energy is essential to mobilize and sustain radical change. This paper draws on community development theories and practices, as well as identity theories, to develop a model that traces the dynamic processes by which hot emotional interpretations and relatively colder cognitive interpretations interact to initiate, mobilize, and sustain radical change. It highlights the roles that emotion and cognition play as both barriers and essential facilitators of the change at different stages of the process, and proposes a set of strategies for managing them.</p>
            <p>A central proposition in organization theory is that discrete organizational forms are matched to environmental conditions, market strategies, or exchange conditions. This paper develops a contrary theoretical proposition. We argue that efficiency may dictate modulating between discrete governance modes (i.e., structural modulation) in response to a stable set of exchange conditions. If governance choices are discrete, as much of organization theory argues, then the consequent steady-state functionality delivered by these organizational forms is itself discrete. However, if the desired functionality lies in-between the steady-state functionality delivered by two discrete choices, then efficiency gains may be available by modulating between modes. We develop an analytical model of structural modulation and examine factors that influence when modulation is efficiency enhancing, as well as the optimal rate of modulation. We conclude that under certain conditions structural modulation is efficiency enhancing. Further, contrary to theories that highlight the potentially destructive consequences of inertia on organizational survival, we identify important efficiency-yielding benefits of inertia.</p>
            <p>Traditional approaches to organizational change have been dominated by assumptions privileging stability, routine, and order. As a result, organizational change has been reified and treated as exceptional rather than natural. In this paper, we set out to offer an account of organizational change on its own terms-to treat change as the normal condition of organizational life. The central question we address is as follows: What must organization(s) be like if change is constitutive of reality? Wishing to highlight the pervasiveness of change in organizations, we talk about organizational becoming. Change, we argue, is the reweaving of actors' webs of beliefs and habits of action to accommodate new experiences obtained through interactions. Insofar as this is an ongoing process, that is to the extent actors try to make sense of and act coherently in the world, change is inherent in human action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human action. In this view, organization is a secondary accomplishment, in a double sense. Firstly, organization is the attempt to order the intrinsic flux of human action, to channel it towards certain ends by generalizing and institutionalizing particular cognitive representations. Secondly, organization is a pattern that is constituted, shaped, and emerging from change. Organization aims at stemming change but, in the process of doing so, it is generated by it. These claims are illustrated by drawing on the work of several organizational ethnographers. The implications of this view for theory and practice are outlined.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we integrate findings from three field studies of technology intensive organizations to explore the process through which change occurred. In each case, problems were well recognized but had become entrenched and had failed to generate change. Across the three sites, organizational change occurred only after some event altered the accustomed daily rhythms of work, and thus changed the way people experienced time. This finding suggests that temporal shifts-changes in a collective's experience of time-can help to facilitate organizational change. Specifically, we suggest that temporal shifts enable change in four ways: (1) by creating a trigger for change, (2) by providing resources needed for change, (3) by acting as a coordinating mechanism, and (4) by serving as a credible symbol of the need to change.</p>
            <p>Drawing on neoclassical economic, internal labor market, and devaluation theories, we examine how the sex composition of jobs and the sex of individual workers affect earnings, depending upon the formalization of the pay type. Using personnel data for over 8,000 employees, we confirm the existence of a negative relationship between earnings and the proportion female in a job. We also find that for less-formalized pay types (cash incentive bonuses), sex-composition and individual-sex effects are larger than for more formalized pay (merit raises and base salary). Together, these findings support devaluation explanations, suggest that incentive bonuses may widen the earnings gap between women and men, and have implications for the design of pay structures in organizations.</p>
            <p>In the field of organizational identity, theory development has far outpaced theory testing. Specifically, several researchers have proposed identity-based models of organizational identification but few have operationalized and tested them. Furthermore, virtually no research has explored how members identify with multiple-identity organizations. This study addresses these gaps and makes three specific contributions to identity theory. First, we operationalize and test a model in which a member's organizational identification is conceptualized in terms of an identity comparison process, i.e., a cognitive comparison between what a member perceives the identity to be and what they think it should be. Second, we extend current thinking by operationalizing organizational identification in terms of multiple and competing identities. Third, as a theory-building exercise, we explore the possibility that a similar identity comparison process operates at the organizational form level of analysis, affecting members' identification with the encompassing form or social institution. We test our model via a survey of members of rural cooperatives-a prototypical "hybrid" identity organizational form, embodying elements of both "business" and "family" identities. Results of the analyses show that organizational identity congruence has a significant effect on member commitment, and form-level identity congruence has significant effects on both cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy, lending support for the use of identity as a multilevel construct. These results provide empirical support for current identity-based models of organizational identification and expand their generalizability to include multiple-identity organizations.</p>
            <p>A qualitative, longitudinal study of two groups of experienced professionals beginning work in a research organization provided insights into how newcomers with work experience adjust to and become assimilated into new jobs and work settings. Multiple methods were used to collect data on the newcomers' work experiences before and after assuming their new jobs. Repeated interviews with them during their first six months in their new jobs revealed that their past experience affected their assimilation in three primary ways: through the personal identities they had developed and carried with them, through the know-how they had acquired in past jobs and how well it fit with their new jobs, and through the personal tactics they had learned for managing their work and managing change. In general, newcomers with diverse experience adjusted better than those with narrow experience because (1) they found it easier to enact dimensions of their personal identities that allowed them to function effectively in the new situation, (2) they more easily found a fit between know-how gleaned from that experience and their new jobs, and (3) they could draw on a wider variety of personal tactics that they had previously used to help them adjust.</p>
            <p>A strongly identified workforce presents a paradox during times of radical organizational change. Though it may bind people together behind the change initiative, strong organizationwide identification often blinds and potentially blocks the view of new possibilities. Prior research on identity change has tended to either ignore the paradox or resolve it by advocating some middle ground such as hybrid organizational identities or group-level identifications. This paper presents an identity transformation model that capitalizes on the paradoxical tensions over time by unpacking the processes by which individual and organizational levels of identity interact. It operationalizes the model by suggesting linguistic markers that describe the different stages of the process and rhetorical techniques that leaders can use to guide people through the process. To illustrate the model and its application, the paper highlights moments across a 10-year period at Tech-Co, a high-technology company undergoing a significant identity transformation.</p>
            <p>The study of foreign entry-mode choice has been based almost exclusively on transaction-cost theory. This theory focuses mainly on the impacts of firm- and industry-specific factors on the choice of entry mode, taking the effects of country-specific contextual factors as constant or less important. In contrast, the institutional perspective emphasizes the importance of the influence of both institutional forces embedded in national environments and decision makers' cognitive constraints on the founding conditions of new ventures. Still, this theoretical perspective has yet to provide insights into how institutional factors influence the choice of foreign entry mode. The primary goal of the present study is to provide a unifying theoretical framework to examine this relationship. We synthesize transaction-cost and institutional perspectives to analyze a sample of 364 Japanese overseas subsidiaries. Our results support the notion that institutional theory provides incremental explanatory power of foreign entry-mode choice in addition to transaction-cost theory. In particular, we found that multinational enterprises tend to conform to the regulative settings of the host-country environment, the normative pressures imposed by the local people, and the cognitive mindsets as bounded by counterparts' and multinational enterprises' own entry patterns when making foreign entry-mode choices.</p>
            <p>In this paper we propose the notion of temporal structuring as a way of understanding and studying time as an enacted phenomenon within organizations. We suggest that through their everyday action, actors produce and reproduce a variety of temporal structures which in turn shape the temporal rhythm and form of their ongoing practices. A focus on temporal structuring, combined with a practice perspective, allows us to bridge the subjective-objective dichotomy that underlies much of the existing research on time in organizations. After developing the notion of temporal structuring, we illustrate its use in the context of a prior empirical study. We conclude by outlining some implications of temporal structuring for organizational research on time.</p>
            <p>This paper applies evolutionary economics reasoning to the strategic alliance context and examines whether and how routinization processes at the partnering-firm level influence the performance of the cooperative agreement. In doing so, it introduces the concept of interorganizational routines, defined as stable patterns of interaction among two firms developed and refined in the course of repeated collaborations, and suggests that partner-specific, technology-specific, and general experience accumulation at the partnering-firm level influence the extent to which alliances result in knowledge accumulation, create new growth opportunities, and enable partnering firms to achieve their strategic objectives. We also consider how governance design choices at the transaction level shape the effectiveness of interorganizational routizination processes. Based on a sample of 145 biotechnology alliances, we find that only partner-specific experience has a positive impact on alliance performance, and that this effect is stronger in the absence of equity-based governance mechanisms. We interpret these results to support the role of interfirm coordination and cooperation routines in enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative agreements.</p>
            <p>In today's turbulent business environment innovation is the result of the interplay between two distinct but related factors: endogenous R&amp;D efforts and (quasi) external acquisition of technology and know-how. Given the increasing importance of innovation, it is vital to understand more about the alternative mechanisms-such as alliances and acquisitions-that can be used to enhance the innovative performance of companies. Most of the literature has dealt with these alternatives as isolated issues. Companies, however, are constantly challenged to choose between acquisitions and strategic alliances, given the limited resources that can be spent on research and development. This paper contributes to the literature because it focuses on the choice between innovation-related alliances and acquisitions. We focus on the question of how the trade-off between strategic alliances and acquisitions is influenced by previous direct and indirect ties between firms in an industry network of interfirm alliances. We formulate hypotheses pertaining to the number of direct ties between two companies, their proximity in the overall alliance network, and their centrality in that network. In so doing, we distinguish between ties that connect firms from the same and from different industry segments, and those that connect firms from the same or from different world regions. These hypotheses are tested on a sample of strategic alliances and acquisitions in the application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) industry. The findings show that a series of strategic alliances between two partners increases the probability that one will ultimately acquire the other. Whereas previous direct contacts tend to lead to an acquisition, this is not true of previous indirect contacts, which increase the probability that a link between the companies, once it is forged, takes the form of a strategic alliance. In the case of acquisitions, firms that are more centrally located in the network of interfirm alliances tend to be acquirers, and firms with a less central position tend to become acquired. These findings underscore the importance of taking previously formed interfirm linkages into account when explaining the choice between strategic alliances and acquisitions, as these existing links influence the transaction costs associated with both alternatives.</p>
            <p>This paper provides a mathematical and economic analysis of "Incentives and Computing Systems for Team-Based Organizations" by A. Barua, C. H. Sophie Lee, and A. B. Whinston, which was published in Organization Science in 1995. Several points were not adequately stated in the original article and one of the key definitions is not clear, nor is it in keeping with the classical theory of production. Although the Cobb-Douglas production function is often used in the article, it does not comply with the article's definitions. The two main contributions of this paper are (1) to provide a word of caution to other readers who might try to extend Barua et al. (1995) and (2) to suggest alternative formulations and directions for future research.</p>
            <p>We use panel data on ISO 9000 quality certification in 85 countries between 1993 and 1998 to better understand the cross-national diffusion of an organizational practice. Following neoinstitutional theory, we focus on the coercive, normative, and mimetic effects that result from the exposure of firms in a given country to a powerful source of critical resources, a common pool of relevant technical knowledge, and the experiences of firms located in other countries. We use social network theory to develop a systematic conceptual understanding of how firms located in different countries influence each other's rates of adoption as a result of cohesive and equivalent network relationships. Regression results provide support for our predictions that states and foreign multinationals are the key actors responsible for coercive isomorphism, cohesive trade relationships between countries generate coercive and normative effects, and role-equivalent trade relationships result in learning-based and competitive imitation.</p>

            <p>Although the niche figures prominently in contemporary theories of organization, analysts often fail to tie micro processes within the niche to long-term changes in the broader environment. In this paper, we advance arguments about the relationship between an organization's niche and evolution in the structure of its organizational population over time. We focus on the technological niche and processes of positioning and crowding among firms in the niche space, relating them to the level of concentration among all firms in the market. Building on previous empirical studies in organizational ecology, we study the evolution of concentration in the American automobile industry from 1885 to 1981 and estimate models of the hazard of exit of individual producers from the market. The findings show that niche and concentration interact in complex ways, yielding a more unified depiction of organizational evolution than typically described or reported.</p>

            <p>To better understand the factors that support or inhibit internally focused change, we conducted an inductive study of one firm's attempt to improve two of its core business processes. Our data suggest that the critical determinants of success in efforts to learn and improve are the interactions between managers' attributions about the cause of poor organizational performance and the physical structure of the workplace, particularly delays between investing in improvement and recognizing the rewards. Building on this observation, we propose a dynamic model capturing the mutual evolution of those attributions, managers' and workers' actions, and the production technology. We use the model to show how managers' beliefs about those who work for them, workers' beliefs about those who manage them, and the physical structure of the environment can coevolve to yield an organization characterized by conflict, mistrust, and control structures that prevent useful change of any type.</p>

            <p>We examine interpersonal congruence, the degree to which group members see others in the group as others see themselves, as a moderator of the relationship between diversity and group effectiveness. A longitudinal study of 83 work groups revealed that diversity tended to improve creative task performance in groups with high interpersonal congruence, whereas diversity undermined the performance of groups with low interpersonal congruence. This interaction effect also emerged on measures of social integration, group identification, and relationship conflict. By eliciting self-verifying appraisals, members of some groups achieved enough interpersonal congruence during their first ten minutes of interaction to benefit their group outcomes four months later. In contrast to theories of social categorization, the interpersonal congruence approach suggests that group members can achieve harmonious and effective work processes by expressing rather than suppressing the characteristics that make them unique.</p>

            <p>To examine the consequences of a period of extraordinary success for the long-term adaptive capability of a firm's strategy-making process, this comparative longitudinal study of Andy Grove's tenure as Intel Corporation's chief executive officer (CEO) documents how he moved Intel's strategy-making process from an internal-ecology model to the classical rational-actor model during 1987-1998. His creation of a highly successful strategy vector pursued through an extremely focused induced-strategy process led to coevolutionary lock-in with the personal computer market segment, in which Intel's strategy making became increasingly tied to its existing product market. Intracompany analysis of four new business development cases highlights the inertial consequences of coevolutionary lock-in. The paper examines implications of coevolutionary lock-in in terms of its effect on balancing induced and autonomous strategy processes and exploitation and exploration in organizational learning.</p>
            <p>This paper uses an analysis of developments in aircraft engine control systems to explore the implications of specialization in knowledge production for the organization and the boundaries of the firm. We argue that the definition of boundaries of the firm in terms of the activities performed in house does not take into account that decisions to outsource production and other functions are different from decisions to outsource technological knowledge. We show that multitechnology firms need to have knowledge in excess of what they need for what they make, to cope with imbalances caused by uneven rates of development in the technologies on which they rely and with unpredictable product-level interdependencies. By knowing more, multitechnology firms can coordinate loosely coupled networks of suppliers of equipment, components, and specialized knowledge and maintain a capability for systems integration. Networks enable them to benefit from the advantages of both integration and specialization. Examples from other industries extend to other contexts the model we develop.</p>
            <p>This study examines the role of downsizing in the deinstitutionalization of permanent employment among publicly listed companies in Japan between 1990 and 1997. We found that although economic pressure triggered downsizing, social and institutional pressures shaped the pace and process by which downsizing spread. Large, old, wholly domestically owned, and high-reputation Japanese firms were resistant to downsizing at first, as were firms with high levels of human capital, as reflected by high wages, but these social and institutional pressures diminished as downsizing spread across the population. We argue that this breakdown of social constraints was due to a safety-in-numbers effect: as downsizing became more prominent, the actions of any single firm were less likely to be noticed and criticized, and the effect of the institutional factors that once constrained downsizing diminished.</p>
            <p>This study develops a model of engagement in the multiple roles of work and family. I examine two competing arguments about the effects of engaging in multiple roles, depletion and enrichment, and integrate them by identifying the type of emotional response to a role, negative or positive, as a critical contrasting assumption held by these two perspectives. Moreover, I represent depletion and enrichment as complex multistep processes that include multiple constructs, such as engagement and emotion. This study jointly examines both the depleting and enriching processes that link engagement in one role to engagement in another, using structural equation modeling. Findings from a survey of 790 employees reveal evidence for both depletion and enrichment as well as gender differences. Specifically, depletion existed only for women and only in the work-to-family direction. Men experienced enrichment from work to family, while women experienced enrichment from family to work. Overall, more linkages were found between work and family for women than for men.</p>
            <p>This paper reports on a qualitative field study of 16 hospitals implementing an innovative technology for cardiac surgery. We examine how new routines are developed in organizations in which existing routines are reinforced by the technological and organizational context. All hospitals studied had top-tier cardiac surgery departments with excellent reputations and patient outcomes yet exhibited striking differences in the extent to which they were able to implement a new technology that required substantial changes in the operating-room-team work routine. Successful implementers underwent a qualitatively different team learning process than those who were unsuccessful. Analysis of qualitative data suggests that implementation involved four process steps: enrollment, preparation, trials, and reflection. Successful implementers used enrollment to motivate the team, designed preparatory practice sessions and early trials to create psychological safety and encourage new behaviors, and promoted shared meaning and process improvement through reflective practices. By illuminating the collective learning process among those directly responsible for technology implementation, we contribute to organizational research on routines and technology adoption.</p>
            <p>This study examines whether board interlock ties facilitate second-order imitation, in which firms imitate an underlying decision process that can be adapted to multiple policy domains, rather than imitating specific policies of tied-to firms (first-order imitation). Longitudinal analyses of archival data for a large sample of Forbes/Fortune 500 companies, as well as analyses of survey data on mimetic processes among these firms, show that network ties to firms that use imitation to determine a particular policy can prompt use of imitation by the focal firm in determining both that policy and a different policy. Firms that have board network ties to firms in other industries that imitate their competitors' business strategy are likely to imitate their own competitors' business strategy, as well as their competitors' acquisition activity and compensation policy. Thus, the findings reveal network effects that are not visible with extant perspectives on interorganizational imitation. We discuss implications for institutional theory and research on interorganizational networks.</p>
            <p>We examine how interaction between mid-level managers in technical committees facilitates subsequent alliance formation in a longitudinal study of 87 cellular service providers and equipment manufacturers. Joint participation by firms in technical committees helps them identify potential alliance partners and particular opportunities for technical collaboration. This effect is magnified by sustained participation by individuals on behalf of their firms, demonstrating that interfirm relationships are enhanced by the interpersonal bonds that are forged in technical committees. In contrast, we find that the effect of joint technical committee participation on alliance formation decreases as firms have more prior alliances, suggesting that technical committees provide a more critical avenue for knowledge exchange when firms do not have the luxury of exchanging information through contractual linkages. Taken together, these findings suggest one venue where managerial action can transform existing social structure, because technical committee activity facilitates the entry of less-established firms into alliance networks.</p>

            <p>We use a sensemaking lens to illuminate the microprocesses underlying socially embedded transactions, investigating how social ties affect the logic of exchange governing the transaction. In transcripts of 87 two-party negotiations, we find that most pairs quickly coordinate a shared logic of exchange and improvise in accord with its implied rules throughout their interaction. The improvisations take the form of opening up, working together, or haggling. Negotiators turn to three dynamic processes-trust testing, process clarification, and emotional punctuation-when they have difficulty moving the interaction toward a coherent, mutually agreed upon improvisation. We examine in detail the few asymmetric negotiations, which do not involve a shared logic of exchange. Social ties ease coordination within the negotiation and nearly eliminate asymmetry. We explore how an understanding of the micro-processes underlying negotiations reveals the underpinnings of market exchange.</p>

            <p>Data on Silicon Valley law firms over a 50-year period were used to study the genealogy of organizational populations and its consequences for organizational life chances when a member of an existing firm leaves to found a new firm. Hypotheses and subsequent analysis suggest that the transfer of resources and routines between a parent organization and its progeny decreases life chances for the parent firm and increases life chances for the progeny. The results are contingent on the founder's previous position in the parent firm and time since the parenting event. In addition, I find that progeny have lower life chances when the parent is a failing firm, when there are multiple parents, and when the founder is a former senior partner of a large law firm.</p>

            <p>We use an established model of organizational identification to try to understand the voluntary cooperative behavior of professionals in organizations. We examined the relationships among physicians' assessments of the attractiveness of a health care system's perceived identity and construed external image, strength of system identification, and cooperative behaviors. We surveyed 1,504 physicians affiliated with three health care systems and collected follow-up data from 285 physicians a year later. Attractiveness of perceived identity and construed external image were positively related to physicians' identification with the system, which in turn was positively related to cooperative behavior. Extensions to the model of organizational identification are suggested.</p>
            <p>This paper uses two laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of contracts on interpersonal trust. We predict that the use of binding contracts to promote or mandate cooperation will lead interacting parties to attribute others' cooperation to the constraints imposed by the contract rather than to the individuals themselves, thus reducing the likelihood of trust developing. We also predict that, although non-binding contracts may not generate as much initial cooperation as binding contracts, they will generate personal rather than situational attributions for any cooperation that results and will therefore not interfere with trust development. Two experiments investigated the effects of the use and removal of binding and non-binding contracts. When binding contracts that were previously allowed were no longer allowed or no longer chosen, trust dropped significantly. In contrast, non-binding contracts led to considerable cooperation, and their removal reduced trust less than removing binding contracts. Behavioral and perceptual data suggest that non-binding contracts lead to personal attributions for cooperation and thus may provide an optimal basis for building interpersonal trust in a variety of situations.</p>

            <p>This research investigated how experiences in a particular boundary-spanning context (community outreach) affected members' organizational identity and identification. Multimethod panel data from 219 participants showed that intergroup comparisons with clients (emphasizing differences) and intragroup comparisons with other organization members (emphasizing similarities) changed how members construed their organization's defining qualities. Intergroup comparisons also enhanced the esteem members derived from organizational membership, which, in turn, strengthened organizational identification. Supervisors reported higher interpersonal cooperation and work effort for members whose organizational identification became stronger. The results reveal potential outcomes of boundary-spanning work as well as how organizational identification processes operate in everyday work contexts.</p>
            <p>This paper extends social categorization theory to understand how personality traits related to information sharing may correspond with positive perceptions of demographically different people, thereby enhancing their experience and performance in organizations. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of MBA candidates and a sample of financial services firm officers and found that people who were more demographically different from their coworkers engendered more negative impressions than did more similar coworkers. These impressions were more positive, however, when demographically different people were either more extraverted or higher self-monitors. Further, impressions formed of others mediated the influence of demographic differences on an individual's performance such that the negative effect of being demographically different disappeared when the relationship between impression formation and performance was considered. This suggests that demographically different people may have more control over the impressions others form of them than has been considered in previous research.</p>

            <p>In a study of a sample of 2,705 international plant location decisions by listed Japanese multinational corporations across a possible set of 155 countries in the 1990-1996 period, we use neoinstitutional theory and research on political institutions to explain organizational entry into new geographic markets. We extend neoinstitutional theory's proposition that prior decisions and actions by other organizations provide legitimization and information to a decision marked by uncertainty, showing that this effect holds when the uncertainty comes from a firm's lack of experience in a market but not when the uncertainty derives from the structure of a market's policymaking apparatus.</p>
            <p>This paper considers the role of design, as the emergent arrangement of concrete details that embodies a new idea, in mediating between innovations and established institutional fields as entrepreneurs attempt to introduce change. Analysis of Thomas Edison's system of electric lighting offers insights into how the grounded details of an innovation's design shape its acceptance and ultimate impact. The notion of robust design is introduced to explain how Edison's design strategy enabled his organization to gain acceptance for an innovation that would ultimately displace the existing institutions of the gas industry. By examining the principles through which design allows entrepreneurs to exploit the established institutions while simultaneously retaining the flexibility to displace them, this analysis highlights the value of robust design strategies in innovation efforts, including the phonograph, the online service provider, and the digital video recorder.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the dynamics of social influence in the choices of securities analysts to initiate and abandon coverage of firms listed on the NASDAQ national market. We show that social proof-using the actions of others to infer the value of a course of action-creates information cascades in which decision makers initiate coverage of a firm when peers have recently begun coverage. Analysts that initiate coverage of a firm in the wake of a cascade are particularly prone to overestimating the firm's future profitability, however, and they are subsequently more likely than other analysts to abandon coverage of the firm. We thus find evidence for a cycle of imitation-driven choice followed by disappointment and abandonment. Our account suggests that institutionalization rooted in imitation is likely to be fragile.</p>

            <p>We analyzed two sets of U.S. presidents' speeches to determine whether their propensities to convey images in words were linked to perceptions of their charisma and greatness. As predicted, presidents who engaged in more image-based rhetoric in their inaugural addresses were rated higher in charisma (Study 1). Presidents who engaged in more image-based rhetoric in speeches that historians considered their most significant ones were rated higher in both charisma and greatness (Study 2). Together, these findings suggest that the successful articulation and enactment of a leader's vision may rest on his or her ability to paint followers a verbal picture of what can be accomplished with their help.</p>
            <p>This article examines the role that the quantity of nonnovel events plays in precipitating disaster through the development of a formal (mathematical) system-dynamics model. Building on existing case studies of disaster, we develop a general theory of how an organizational system responds to an on-going stream of non-novel interruptions to existing plans and procedures. We show how an overaccumulation of interruptions can shift an organizational system from a resilient, self-regulating regime, which offsets the effects of this accumulation, to a fragile, self-escalating regime that amplifies them. We offer a new characterization of the conditions under which organizations may be prone to major disasters caused by an accumulation of minor interruptions. Our analysis provides both theoretical insights into the causes of organizational crises and practical suggestions for those charged with preventing them.</p>

            <p>Based on a three-year inductive field study of an attempt at radical change in a large firm, I show how middle managers displayed two seemingly opposing emotion-management patterns that facilitated beneficial adaptation for their work groups: (1) emotionally committing to personally championed change projects and (2) attending to recipients' emotions. Low emotional commitment to change led to organizational inertia, whereas high commitment to change with little attending to recipients' emotions led to chaos. The enactment of both patterns constituted emotional balancing and facilitated organizational adaptation: change, continuity in providing quality in customer service, and developing new knowledge and skills.</p>

            <p>Prevailing research claims that strong corporate cultures improve firm performance by facilitating internal behavioral consistency. This paper addresses an unexamined implication of this argument by analyzing the effect of strong corporate cultures on the variability of firm performance. This relationship depends on how strong cultures affect organizational learning in response to internal and external change. I hypothesize that strong-culture firms excel at incremental change but encounter difficulties in more volatile environments. Results of analyses of a sample of firms from a broad variety of industries show that in relatively stable environments, strong-culture firms have more reliable (less variable) performance. In volatile environments, however, the reliability benefits of strong cultures disappear.</p>
            <p>To examine the effects of interorganizational network structures on acquisition decisions, we propose a model whereby firms learn by sampling the diverse experiences of their network partners. We tested this model by examining the effect of diversity of network partners' experience on firms' acquisition decisions, using data on acquisition premiums and acquirers' stock market performance from 1986 to 1997. Results show that firms tied to others with heterogeneous prior premium experience tend to pay less for their acquisitions and have better-performing acquisitions than those tied to others with homogeneous experience. Firms also pay lower premiums when their network partners (1) have completed deals of diverse sizes, (2) have unique information, and (3) are themselves of diverse sizes. Firms that have multiplex relationships with their partners receive even more benefit. The results extend prior research on networks and learning by showing that collective network experience affects firms' decision quality.</p>
            <p>This paper uses a longitudinal case study of the mutual fund provider, The Vanguard Group, to understand the developmental processes that lead to organizational configurations and fit. A new method for determining an organization's core elements is developed, and four processes are identified that describe the creation and subsequent elaboration of these core elements: thickening (reinforcement of an existing core element by new elaborating elements), patching (creation of a new core element and its reinforcement by new elaborating elements), coasting (no further elaboration of a new core element in a given period), and trimming (deletion of a core element and its elaborating elements). The four processes are used to describe organizations' development paths toward configurations and their transitions between configurations, including two new ideal types, termed thin-to-thick and patch-by-patch, as well as two known paths between configurations, the punctuated equilibrium path and reorientation through linear progression.</p>

            <p>Using data on accidents and incidents experienced by U.S. commercial airlines from 1983 to 1997, we investigated variation in firm learning by examining whether firms learn more from errors with heterogeneous or homogeneous causes. We measured learning by a reduction in airline accident and incident rates, while controlling for other factors related to accidents and incidents. Our results show that heterogeneity is generally better for learning, as prior heterogeneity in the causes of errors decreases subsequent accident rates, producing a deeper, broader search for causality than simple explanations like "blame the pilot." The benefits of heterogeneity, however, apply mainly to specialist airlines. Generalist airlines learn, instead, from outside factors such as the experience of others and general improvements in technology. These results suggest a theory of learning across organizational forms: complex forms benefit from simple information, and simple forms benefit from complex information. The implications of our study for learning theories and work on organizational errors are discussed.</p>
            <p>Group emotional contagion, the transfer of moods among people in a group, and its influence on work group dynamics was examined in a laboratory study of managerial decision making using multiple, convergent measures of mood, individual attitudes, behavior, and group-level dynamics. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design, with a trained confederate enacting mood conditions, the predicted effect of emotional contagion was found among group members, using both outside coders' ratings of participants' mood and participants' self-reported mood. No hypothesized differences in contagion effects due to the degree of pleasantness of the mood expressed and the energy level with which it was conveyed were found. There was a significant influence of emotional contagion on individual-level attitudes and group processes. As predicted, the positive emotional contagion group members experienced improved cooperation, decreased conflict, and increased perceived task performance. Theoretical implications and practical ramifications of emotional contagion in groups and organizations are discussed.</p>
            <p>This research explores the impact of process management activities on technological innovation. Drawing on research in organizational evolution and learning, we suggest that as these practices reduce variance in organizational routines and influence the selection of innovations, they enhance incremental innovation at the expense of exploratory innovation. We tested our hypotheses in a 20-year longitudinal study of patenting activity and ISO 9000 quality program certifications in the paint and photography industries. In both industries, the extent of process management activities in a firm was associated with an increase in both exploitative innovations that built on existing firm knowledge and an increase in exploitation's share of total innovations. Our results suggest that exploitation crowds out exploration. We extend existing empirical research by capturing how process management activities influence the extent to which innovations build on existing firm knowledge. We suggest that these widely adopted organizational practices shift the balance of exploitation and exploration by focusing on efficiency, possibly at the expense of long-term adaptation.</p>

            <p>This paper integrates corporate governance research on the consequences of executive power and the upper echelons literature on top managers' cognitive orientation to develop a framework in which the characteristics of the chief executive officer (CEO) predict corporate strategic refocusing. With data from a sample of large and diversified firms, we examine the extent to which newly appointed CEOs' strategic orientation determines whether they use their power to maintain the status quo or refocus their firms' business portfolios. We assess CEOs' power with seven widely used indicators and use experience as heir apparent to the prior CEO as a measure of new CEOs' strategic orientation. Overall, results show that CEOs' power use is influenced by heir apparent experience in predicting the level of corporate strategic refocusing. Heir apparent experience interacts with four power indicators-compensation, functional expertise, elite education, and number of outside boards on which the new CEO is seated-but the interaction between heir apparent experience and number of outside boards is contrary to what was hypothesized.</p>
            <p>This paper theorizes that relatively poor firm performance can prompt chief executive officers (CEOs) to seek more advice from executives of other firms who are their friends or similar to them and less advice from acquaintances or dissimilar others and suggests how and why this pattern of advice seeking could reduce firms' propensity to change corporate strategy in response to poor performance. We test our hypotheses with large-sample survey data on the identities of CEOs' advice contacts and archival data on firm performance and corporate strategy. The results confirm our hypotheses and show that executives' social network ties can influence firms' responses to economic adversity, in particular by inhibiting strategic change in response to relatively poor firm performance. Additional findings indicate that CEOs' advice seeking in response to low performance may ultimately have negative consequences for subsequent performance, suggesting how CEOs' social network ties could play an indirect role in organizational decline and downward spirals in firm performance.</p>

            <p>We examine factors leading multiunit chains to adopt a common naming strategy, that is, naming components in a manner that identifies them with each other and the overall chain, rather than a local naming strategy that identifies a chain's components with their locations but not each other. Because chains' naming strategies have been shown to be critical to their success, we examine the effects of component failures on naming strategies. We advance organizational and interorganizational learning processes to explain chains' adoption of local naming strategies, which stress local adaptation, or common naming strategies, which emphasize standardization. In contrast to past research emphasizing learning from success, we focus on learning from the failure of strategy, specifically, the failure of a chain's own and other chains' commonly and locally named components. Two fundamental results emerge from our analysis of Ontario nursing home chains' naming strategies from 1971 to 1996. One is that nursing home chains learned from their own and others' failures, and the second is that the chains learned less from failures when they had a historical investment in the failing strategy.</p>
            <p>This article develops and tests theory on when and where a new organizational form will emerge. Recent theory holds that as the number of organizations using a particular external identity code first increases beyond a critical minimal level, the code becomes an organizational form. Going beyond this formulation, we theorize about how an external identity code is established. We argue that when the identities of individual organizations are perceptually focused, they will more readily cohere into a distinct collective identity. We develop ideas about how two observable aspects of organizations might generate perceptually focused identities in a common market: (1) de novo entry and (2) agglomeration in a geographic place with a related identity. Using comprehensive data from the market for disk drive arrays, we test these ideas and an alternative by estimating effects of different specifications of organizational and product densities on rates of entry and exit for array producers. Overall, the analysis supports the notion that firms with perceptually focused identities aid in establishing an organizational form.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we challenge the traditional understanding of organizational routines as creating inertia in organizations. We adapt Latour's distinction between ostensive and performative to build a theory that explains why routines are a source of change as well as stability. The ostensive aspect of a routine embodies what we typically think of as the structure. The performative aspect embodies the specific actions, by specific people, at specific times and places, that bring the routine to life. We argue that the ostensive aspect enables people to guide, account for, and refer to specific performances of a routine, and the performative aspect creates, maintains, and modifies the ostensive aspect of the routine. We argue that the relationship between ostensive and performative aspects of routines creates an on-going opportunity for variation, selection, and retention of new practices and patterns of action within routines and allows routines to generate a wide range of outcomes, from apparent stability to considerable change. This revised ontology of organizational routines provides a better explanation of empirical findings than existing theories of routines and has implications for a wide range of organizational theories.</p>
            <p>This paper develops and tests a theory of expertise recognition and utilization in groups that focuses on the critical role of members' status cues as indicators of task expertise. The theory draws on status characteristics theory and past research on groups to propose that while attributions of expertise in work groups will be informed by both specific (i.e., task-relevant) and diffuse (i.e., social category) status cues, the strength of this association will be contingent on the type of cue as well as on characteristics of the group context. So, whereas specific status cues will better predict attributions of expertise in decentralized, longer-tenured groups, diffuse status cues will better predict attributions of expertise in centralized, shorter-tenured groups. Further, attributions of expertise should fully mediate the relationship between members' status cues and intragroup influence. A multilevel test of these hypotheses in a sample of self-managed production teams in a Fortune 100 high-technology firm provides strong support. Group-level analyses confirm that the alignment of intragroup influence with specific status cues is positively associated with group performance.</p>
            <p>The kibbutz, once lauded as an exemplar of the utopian organization, has been criticized recently as yet another illustration that socialist arrangements are inferior to capitalist ones. In this paper, we test a number of explanations of what happened to the kibbutz, using an analysis of the founding rate of the kibbutz population. We find support for popular accounts that the kibbutz stagnated partly as a result of the development in Israel of capitalism and of alternatives for structuring community relations. We also find that a less recognized influence, the state, was a critical determinant of favorable and unfavorable kibbutz outcomes. Our analysis shows that early in the twentieth century, the kibbutz flourished as a source of the order that the states to which it was subject were unable to provide. Over time, the states of Palestine and Israel developed more capacity to govern and displaced the kibbutz from the order-provision role. We also show an active rivalry, with the State of Israel attacking the kibbutz to shore up its own autonomy and in the process delegitimizing the kibbutz movement. These results suggest revisions to the conclusions that are typically drawn from the "kibbutz experiment." They also suggest that some organizational forms may experience symbiosis, competition, and rivalry with the state and that these factors can be key determinants of the state's actions and the forms' evolution.</p>

            <p>I used qualitative methods to explore why some employees working in a newly created, non-territorial office environment perceived that their workplace identities were threatened and used particular tactics to affirm those threatened identities. Findings suggest that the non-territorial work environment threatened some employees' workplace identities because it severely limited their abilities to affirm categorizations of distinctiveness (versus status) through the display of personal possessions. Categorizations of distinctiveness appeared to be most threatened by the loss of office personalization because of three characteristics: (1) their absolute, rather than graded membership structure, (2) their high subjective importance and personal relevance, and (3) their high reliance on physical markers for affirmation. In affirming threatened identity categorizations, employees chose different tactics, in terms of the amount of effort required and their conformance with company rules, based on the acceptability and importance of affirming the threatened categorization.</p>
            <p>This paper extends organizational imprinting theory to networks by examining how the social technology available during the establishment of community-based intercorporate networks continues to influence contemporary network structures despite major changes in the U.S. corporate environment. I examine the 51 largest U.S. community network systems in 1986, the same networks in 2000, and the network activity of the component organizations of those network systems. Results show that even when controlling for many plausible alternative explanations, communities established prior to the advent of air travel technology have preserved locally focused networks, which suggests that this pattern is maintained by emulation of locally legitimate templates of action. This research contributes to work on imprinting by extending it to networks and in theorizing the social mechanisms that result in the persistence of social forms. Furthermore, it contributes to work on directorship networks by suggesting that the way information flows through this network may be geographically contingent.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we examine the ecological consequences of initial public offerings (IPOs) and acquisitions, specifically how the spatial distribution of these events influences the location-specific founding rates of new companies. We explore whether relatively small spatial units (metropolitan statistical areas) in close geographic proximity to firms that recently have been acquired or experienced an IPO exhibit high new venture creation rates and whether the magnitudes of these effects depend on regional differences in statutes governing the freedom of employees to move between employers. Count models of biotechnology firm foundings establish three findings: (1) IPOs of organizations located contiguous to or within an MSA accelerate the founding rate within that MSA, (2) acquisitions of biotech firms situated near to or within an MSA accelerate the founding rate within the MSA, but only when the acquirer enters from outside of the biotech industry, and (3) the enforceability of post-employment non-compete covenants, which is determined at the state level, strongly moderates these effects.</p>

            <p>This paper examines the relationship between subgroups and team learning behavior, defined as a cycle of experimentation, reflective communication, and codification. We develop the construct of "subgroup strength," defined as the degree of overlap across multiple demographic characteristics among a subset of team members. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we propose that the presence of subgroups within a team may stimulate learning behavior and that organizational design features, such as performance management by an external leader, team empowerment, and the availability of a knowledge management system, may have different effects on teams, depending on subgroup strength. Data on 156 teams in five pharmaceutical and medical products firms confirmed that moderately strong demographic subgroups in teams fostered learning behavior. In addition, both very homogeneous and very heterogeneous teams were more inclined to engage in learning behavior, but only if we controlled for the concurrent effect of subgroup strength. Finally, subgroup strength moderated the impact of organizational design features on team learning. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on team composition, design, and learning by highlighting the importance of subgroups for understanding team behavior.</p>
            <p>This research considers how different features of informal networks affect knowledge transfer. As a complement to previous research that has emphasized the dyadic tie strength component of informal networks, we focus on how network structure influences the knowledge transfer process. We propose that social cohesion around a relationship affects the willingness and motivation of individuals to invest time, energy, and effort in sharing knowledge with others. We further argue that the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a person's ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences. We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract R&amp;D firm. The results indicate that both social cohesion and network range ease knowledge transfer, over and above the effect for the strength of the tie between two people. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on effective knowledge transfer, social capital, and information diffusion.</p>
            <p>Companies are increasingly asked to provide innovative solutions to deep-seated problems of human misery, even as economic theory instructs managers to focus on maximizing their shareholders' wealth. In this paper, we assess how organization theory and empirical research have thus far responded to this tension over corporate involvement in wider social life. Organizational scholarship has typically sought to reconcile corporate social initiatives with seemingly inhospitable economic logic. Depicting the hold that economics has had on how the relationship between the firm and society is conceived, we examine the consequences for organizational research and theory by appraising both the 30-year quest for an empirical relationship between a corporation's social initiatives and its financial performance, as well as the development of stakeholder theory. We propose an alternative approach, embracing the tension between economic and broader social objectives as a starting point for systematic organizational inquiry. Adopting a pragmatic stance, we introduce a series of research questions whose answers will reveal the descriptive and normative dimensions of organizational responses to misery.</p>
            <p>In this study, we consider the social process by which the corporate elite may have resisted pressure from stakeholders to adopt changes in corporate governance that limit managerial autonomy. We examine (1) how directors who participate in corporate governance changes that reflect greater board control over management may be subjected to a kind of informal social sanctioning, which we refer to as social distancing, on other boards; (2) how the tendency for directors to experience social distancing may be moderated by their status in the corporate elite; and (3) how directors who experience such social control could be deterred from participating subsequently in governance changes that threaten the interests of fellow top managers. We test our hypotheses with survey data on processes of social control from a sample of directors and CEOs at Forbes 500 companies and archival data on director participation in four corporate governance changes. The findings show that (1) directors who participate in governance changes that threaten managerial interests experience a higher level of social distancing on other boards, particularly when they have low to medium status in the corporate elite, and (2) directors are less likely to participate in such changes if they have recently experienced social distancing (directly or indirectly). Our theory and empirical tests ultimately address the question of how, or by what social process, boards of directors help maintain the solidarity of the corporate elite and serve the interests of corporate leaders.</p>
            <p>Initial architectural change in organizations often induces other subsequent changes, generating lengthy cascades of changes in subordinate units. This article extends a formal model of cascading organizational change by examining the implications for organizational change of the limited foresight of those who initiate such change about unit interconnections (structural opacity) and the normative restrictiveness imposed on architectural features by organizational culture (cultural asperity). Opacity leads actors to underestimate the lengths of periods of reorganization and the associated costs of change, thereby prompting them unwittingly to undertake changes with adverse consequences. Increased opacity and asperity lengthen the total time that the organization spends reorganizing and the associated opportunity costs; and the expected effect of an architectural change on mortality hazards increases with the intricacy of the organizational design, structural opacity, and the asperity of organizational culture. We illustrate the theory with an interpretation of the 1995 collapse of Baring Brothers Bank.</p>
            <p>This paper integrates content-based predictions of transaction cost economics with process-based predictions of organizational change to understand adaptation to deregulation in the for-hire trucking industry. We predict and find that firms whose governance of a core transaction is poor (according to transaction cost reasoning) will realize lower profits than their better-aligned counterparts and that these firms will attempt to adapt so as to better align their transactions. Results show that several organizational features affect the rate of adaptation: (1) firms with large investments in specialized assets adapt less readily than firms that rely on generic assets, (2) firms with unions adapt less readily than firms without unions, (3) firms that must replace employee drivers with owner-operators adapt less readily than firms that must replace owner-operators with employee drivers, and (4) entrants adapt more quickly than incumbent carriers. There is evidence of institutional isomorphism in that although carriers move systematically to reduce misalignment, they do so less assiduously when this will make their governance of drivers look less like that of nearby, similar carriers. Finally, our results indicate that firms that ultimately exited adapted more quickly than firms that survived.</p>

            <p>This study focuses on the roles of interfirm ties and network status in firms gaining access to customers in newly entered markets, examining whether these network resources are transferable and therefore can be deployed outside the market in which they originated. The role of market ties and network status is examined in a comprehensive longitudinal sample of commercial banks' entry into investment banking from 1991 to 1997. Results show that though market ties and network status facilitate market entry, the importance of network status decreases in the presence of market ties, and the value of network status, unlike market ties, decreases over time after market entry and is less important to customers with more market experience.</p>

            <p>Research on time in organizations spans disciplines and introduces a wide range of concepts. Here we set out to find an underlying structure to clarify the current state of temporal research. Our examination yields three categories of variables: conceptions of time, mapping activities to time, and actors relating to time. We elaborate intricacies within each category, interrelationships among categories, and assumptions made in each category about the others. We then use the framework to compare existing studies and generate propositions to develop the notion of temporal fit.</p>
            <p>In any investigation of a causal relationship between an X and a Y, the time when X and Y are measured is crucial for determining whether X causes Y, as well as the true strength of that relationship. Using past research and a review of current research, we develop a set of X,Y configurations that describe the main ways that causal relationships are represented in theory and tested in research. We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and analytical issues pertaining to when we measure X and Y and discuss the implications of this analysis for constructing better organizational theories.</p>
            <p>I propose a model in which I describe the way individuals experience timelessness by becoming engrossed in attractive work activities, the contextual conditions that facilitate or hinder that process, and the effects of timelessness on the creativity of organizational members. Building upon multidisciplinary perspectives, I suggest that timelessness is a constellation of four experiences: a feeling of immersion, a recognition of time distortion, a sense of mastery, and a sense of transcendence.</p>

            <p>We examine the dynamics of temporal responsiveness-the ability of organizational actors to adapt the timing of their activities to unanticipated events. We review a broad body of psychological, economic, sociological, anthropological, and organizational research to introduce a reference point model of how people perceive and evaluate time in organizations. We then analyze how actors evaluate timing changes (changes from existing organizational schedules, routines, expectations, and plans).</p>
            <p>Based on a review of existing literature, we propose that two time-oriented individual differences-time urgency and time perspective-influence team members' perceptions of deadlines. We present propositions describing how time urgency and time perspective affect individuals' deadline perceptions and subsequent deadline-oriented behaviors and how different deadline perceptions and behaviors among team members affect the ability of teams to meet deadlines. We end with implications for existing theory and future research.</p>
            <p>I propose four ideal types of planned change processes, each with distinct temporal and nontemporal assumptions, and each associated with altering a distinct organizational element. These types are commanding, engineering, teaching, and socializing. I then argue that large-scale change involves an alteration of multiple organizational elements, thus requiring enactment of multiple intervention ideal types. This requires change agents to display temporal capability skills to effectively sequence, time, pace and combine various interventions.</p>
            <p>In this article we reexamine the relationship between time and processes of institutionalization. We argue that pace and stability, two temporal dimensions of institutionalization, depend on the mechanism used by agents to support the institutionalization process. Drawing from the power literature, we develop four types of mechanisms-influence, force, discipline, and domination-and argue that (1) each type will produce a distinctive pattern of pace and stability, and (2) more complex patterns of pace and stability will result from the combined use of multiple mechanisms.</p>
            <p>While alleviating the adverse effects of employees' pursuit of their subgroups' goals over organizational goals is important finding ways to avoid them may be even more important. In this paper, we investigate whether strategic planning can be used to reduce organizational members' position bias, or the extent to which they direct their attention toward the immediate goals and priorities attached to their position. We examine the hypothesis that involving employees in the strategic planning process and communicating the agreed-upon priorities to them afterwards enhance goal convergence by attenuating position bias. We examine these questions in a sample of 164 manufacturing plants from five countries and three industries, where we asked middle-level managers to assess the importance of various organizational goals. We find that participation and communication function as complements to jointly reduce managerial position bias.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the prior acquisitions literature, which has emphasized the buyer's perspective, we examine the seller's perspective. This has important implications for understanding both the acquisition process and, more broadly, corporate governance in successful firms. Using a multiple-case, inductive study of 12 technology-based ventures, we find that acquisition occurs when sellers are pushed toward acquisition by difficult, albeit natural strategic hurdles, such as a chief executive search or funding round, and by strong personal motivations for sale, such as past failures and investments by friends. Sellers are also more likely to be pulled toward acquisition by attractive buyers that offer synergistic combination potential and organizational rapport, factors usually associated with the long-term interests of buyers. We reframe acquisition as courtship and corporate governance as a syndicate, indicating joint decision making with some common goals, and explore the generalizability of these views for private versus public firms and other contingencies. Together, courtship and syndicate suggest a behaviorally informed account of organization that belies the rhetoric of price and self-interest.</p>
            <p>We employ a computational model of organizational adaptation to answer three research questions: (1) How does the architecture or structure of complexity affect the feasibility and usefulness of boundedly rational design efforts? (2) Do efforts to adapt organizational forms complicate or complement the effectiveness of first-order change efforts? and (3) To what extent does the rate of environmental change nullify the usefulness of design efforts? We employ a computational model of organizational adaptation to examine these questions. Our results, in identifying the boundary conditions around successful design efforts, suggest that the underlying architecture of complexity of organizations, particularly the presence of hierarchy, is a critical determinant of the feasibility and effectiveness of design efforts. We also find that design efforts are generally complementary to efforts at local performance improvement and identify specific contingencies that determine the extent of complementarity. We discuss the implications of our findings for organization theory and design and the literature on modularity in products and organizations.</p>
            <p>This study examines if high- and low-performing project teams differ with respect to how they are mobilized and launched and the effects of their mobilization and launch activities and outputs on subsequent team progress and performance. Comparisons of three high- and three low-performing teams drawn from five major corporations showed that the high performers mobilized relatively quickly, used comprehensive rather than limited mobilization strategies, and conducted participatory rather than programmed launch meetings. This combination of activities produced a constellation of salutary outputs: more time for the teams to do their work, team members with essential task-related competencies and sufficient time to contribute to their projects, and complete rather than partial performance strategies. In turn, the three salutary outputs formed a constellation of key inner resources that propelled the high-performing teams on a virtuous path of reinforcing activities and outputs that, despite difficulties, ultimately led to success, whereas the absence of one or more of these resources led the low-performing teams down a vacuous path of accumulating confusion and inactivity from which they never recovered.</p>
            <p>This paper uses data from career histories of technical contractors to explore how they experience, interpret, and allocate their time and whether they take advantage of the temporal flexibility purportedly offered by contract work in the market. Technical contractors offer a unique opportunity for examining assumptions about organizations, work, and time because they are itinerant professionals who operate outside any single organizational context. We find that contractors do perceive themselves to have flexibility and that a few achieve a kind of flexibility unattained by most permanent employees doing similar work, but rather than take advantage of what they call "beach time" and "downtime," the majority work long hours and rarely schedule their time flexibly. The contractors' use of time is constrained by the cyclic structure of employment, the centrality of reputation in markets for skill, the practice of billing by the hour, and the nature of technical work. Our research suggests that markets place more rather than fewer constraints on workers' time.</p>
            <p>To understand the effects of selection on firm-level learning, this study synthesizes two contrasting views of evolution. Internal selection theorists view managers in multiproduct firms as the primary agents of evolutionary change because they decide whether individual products and technologies are retained or eliminated. In contrast, external selection theorists contend that the environment drives evolution because it determines whether entire firms live or die. Though these theories differ, they describe tightly interwoven processes. In assessing the coevolution of internal and external selection among personal computer manufacturers across a 20-year period, we found that (1) firms learned cumulatively and adaptively from internal and partial external selection, the latter occurring when the environment killed part but not all of a firm; (2) internal and partial external selection co-evolved, as each affected the other's future rate and the odds of firm failure; (3) partial external selection had a greater effect on future outcomes than internal selection; and (4) the lessons gleaned from prior selection were reflected in a firm's ability to develop new products, making that an important mediator between past and future selection events.</p>
            <p>Two field studies tested the hypothesis that high perceived control may serve as an antidote to the negative effects of layoffs on the employees who are not laid off (survivors). In Study 1, some participants witnessed the layoffs of fellow employees, but others did not. In Study 2, all participants survived a layoff, but they varied in the extent to which they experienced the post-layoff environment as threatening to their well-being. Conceptually analogous results emerged across the two studies. Study 1 showed that the negative impact of layoffs on survivors' organizational commitment was reduced when perceived control was relatively high. Study 2 showed that the tendency for survivors' job performance to be adversely affected by high threat to their well-being was reduced when perceived control was relatively high. In other words, perceived control was more strongly related to employees' organizational commitment in the presence than in the absence of layoffs and to survivors' job performance when they experienced the post-layoff environment as more threatening. These findings account for additional variance in the reactions of layoff survivors and identify when perceived control will be more versus less strongly related to employees' work attitudes and behaviors. Practical implications for the management of organizational downsizings are discussed.</p>
            <p>We compare two alternative approaches for evaluating the potential of a work group or team: one that focuses on team members' demographic characteristics and one that focuses on the members' social networks. Given that people's network contacts often share their demographic attributes (i.e., the network is homophilous), the two approaches seem equivalent, and the first seems preferabie because it is easier to implement. In this paper, we demonstrate several important limits to this rationale. First, we argue and show, in an analysis of 1,518 project teams in a contract research and development firm, that even when internal organizational networks are significantly homophilous with respect to demographic variables, the very logic of the causal structure that underlies theories of demographic diversity carries ambiguous performance implications. This ambiguity is due to the fact that demographic diversity has opposing effects on two social network variables-internal density and external range-each of which has a positive effect on a team's performance. We also demonstrate that a focus on demographic criteria is problematic because the demographic makeup of an organization can place inherent limits on a manager's ability to shape the demographic composition of a team. The ambiguous performance implications and the inherent limits placed on a manager's ability to manage a team's demography reduce the likelihood that a manager's interventions will be successful. The performance implications of managing a team's social capital, however, are clear.</p>
            <p>We report on the findings of an inductive, interpretive case study of organizational identity change in the spin-off of a Fortune 100 company's top-performing organizational unit into an independent organization. We examined the processes by which the labels and meanings associated with the organization's identity underwent changes during and after the spin-off, as well as how the organization responded to these changes. The emergent model of identity change revolved around a collective state of identity ambiguity, the details of which provide insight into processes whereby organizational identity change can occur. Additionally, our findings revealed previously unreported aspects of organizational change, including organization members' collective experience of "change overload" and the presence of temporal identity discrepancies in the emergence of the identity ambiguity.</p>
            <p>We examine the mechanisms used to limit expropriation of firm wealth by large shareholders among S&amp;P 500 firms with founding-family ownership. Consistent with agency theory, we find that the most valuable public firms are those in which independent directors balance family board representation. In contrast, in firms with continued founding-family ownership and relatively few independent directors, firm performance is significantly worse than in non-family firms. We also find that a moderate family board presence provides substantial benefits to the firm. Additional tests suggest that families often seek to minimize the presence of independent directors, while outside shareholders seek independent director representation. These findings highlight the importance of independent directors in mitigating conflicts between shareholder groups and imply that the interests of minority investors are best protected when, through independent directors, they have power relative to family shareholders. We argue that expanding the discussion beyond manager-shareholder conflicts to include conflicts between shareholder groups provides a richer setting in which to explore corporate governance and the balance of power in U.S. firms.</p>
            <p>In this article, I discuss the attributes of friendship and advice networks and hypothesize about their roles in maintaining and changing professional values. Advice networks sustain existing professional values in organizations. They are less likely to transmit new values because advice relations reflect current practice and may be negatively affected by changing values. Friendships rest on intimacy and trust rather than on existing task structures, so they can facilitate the development of new professional values without negatively affecting the friendship network. A longitudinal study of networks and teaching values in four public schools documented an initial alignment of advisors' and advisees' teaching values, followed by transmission of new teaching values through the friendship network. Changing professional values altered the advice network but did not affect the friendship network.</p>
            <p>We examine the role of three types of stakeholders in the uneven adoption of an organizational practice in different countries, arguing that organizational practices achieve widespread use only when they are consistent with the interests of the most powerful social actors as enshrined in legal rights. Building on a "stakeholder-power" approach to corporate governance, we examine whether the interests of shareholders, workers, and banks are consistent with the practice of hostile takeovers. Regressions using data on as many as 37 countries between 1988 and 1998 lend support to predictions that hostile takeovers increase in frequency with the extent to which shareholder rights are protected and decrease with the degree to which workers' and banks' rights are protected. We discuss the implications for the analysis of comparative institutions and for organizational theory.</p>
            <p>This study offers a sociopolitical perspective on the international spread of corporate governance models. We unpack the heterogeneity of interests and preferences across and within types of shareholders and senior managers over time in an analysis of the adoption of a shareholder value orientation among contemporary German firms. Using extensive data on more than 100 of the largest publicly traded German companies from 1990 to 2000, we find that the influence of major shareholder groups (e.g., banks, industrial corporations, governments, and families) and senior manager types (differing educational backgrounds and ages) can be clearly observed only after redefining these key actors according to common interests and preferences. We also find evidence that German firms engage in decoupling by espousing but not implementing a shareholder value orientation but show that the presence of more powerful and more committed key actors reduces the likelihood of decoupling. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on symbolic management, the diffusion of corporate practices, and the debate over the convergence of national governance systems.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we question the idea that large organizations have advantages that make them particularly potent rivals. We argue that the ability of large organizations to ameliorate competitive constraints insulates them from an important source of organizational development and protects them from being selected out if unfit. Consequently, we predict that although large organizations are likely to do well in technology contests, they also are likely to become weak competitors over time compared with small organizations. We specify this prediction in an explicit model of "Red Queen" competition, in which exposure to competition makes organizations both more viable and stronger competitors. We find support for our ideas in empirical estimates of the model obtained using data on hard disk drive manufacturers. Large organizations led the technology race in this market yet failed to develop into stronger competitors through Red Queen competition compared with their small counterparts. We also find evidence that all organizations in this market generated increasingly global competition, regardless of the competitiveness of their home markets. In these ways, our model elucidates important reasons why some organizations are stronger competitors and reveals how strategies that isolate organizations from competition may backfire.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we develop a theory to explain why the implementation of new technologies often disrupts occupational roles in ways that delay the expected benefits. To explore these disruptions, we construct a dynamic model grounded in ethnographic data from Barley's widely cited (1986) study of computed tomography (CT) as implemented in two hospitals. Using modeling, we formalize the recursive relationship between the activity of CT scanning and the types and accumulations of knowledge used by doctors and technologists. We find that a balance of expertise across occupational boundaries in operating the technology creates a pattern in which the benefits of the new technology are likely to be realized most rapidly. By operationalizing the dynamics between knowledge and social action, we specify more clearly the recursive relationship between structuring and structure.</p>
            <p>Using social embeddedness arguments, this study examines how the mobility of managers in professional service and client firms affects dissolution among their firms' market ties for that service. My analyses from a sample of agencies and clients in the advertising industry from 1986 to 1998 show that the exit of managers from client firms increases the likelihood that market ties dissolve and that the results are contingent on the size of the firm. In professional service firms, both the exit and promotion of managers affect the number of market tie dissolutions, but these results are contingent on managers' functional roles and the number of market ties maintained by professional service firms. Taken together these findings illustrate how dynamics in managerial labor markets affect market ties for services and how firms' characteristics moderate these effects. The results suggest several refinements to the social embeddedness perspective.</p>

            <p>Researchers have used the absorptive capacity construct to explain various organizational phenomena. In this article we review the literature to identify key dimensions of absorptive capacity and offer a reconceptualization of this construct. Building upon the dynamic capabilities view of the firm, we distinguish between a firm's potential and realized capacity. We then advance a model outlining the conditions when the firm's potential and realized capacities can differentially influence the creation and sustenance of its competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>Little is known about the effectiveness of cross-border transfer of organizational knowledge involving dissimilar cultural contexts. We propose a theoretical framework for understanding the significance of four transacting cultural patterns, defined in terms of the dimensions of individualism-collectivism and verticalness-horizontalness, for their potential in moderating the effectiveness of cross-border transfer of organizational knowledge. Drawing foundational support for this new framework from recent research advances in the area of knowledge transfer, we explore implications for future research.</p>
            <p>We use a dialectical perspective to provide a unique framework for understanding institutional change that more fully captures its totalistic, historical, and dynamic nature, as well as fundamentally resolves a theoretical dilemma of institutional theory: the relative swing between agency and embeddedness. In this framework institutional change is understood as an outcome of the dynamic interactions between two institutional by-products: institutional contradictions and human praxis. In particular, we depict praxis-agency embedded in a totality of multiple levels of interpenetrating, incompatible institutional arrangements (contradictions)-as an essential driving force of institutional change.</p>

In this article I introduce the notion of strategic interventions in intellectual asset flows designed to influence the level and composition of intellectual asset scarcity, with implications for firm performance. I also present propositions that explain and predict how contingencies at differing levels of analysis influence the choice of strategic intervention.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of communication in field-level networks on rates of formation of interorganizational collaborative ties, such as strategic alliances and joint ventures. After developing the concept of an organizational field network ("field-net"), we derive a set of testable propositions and corollaries that relate field-net properties, such as density, reciprocity, centralization, multiplexity, and hierarchy, to subsequent nonlinear changes in interorganizational tie-formation rates. We conclude by discussing aspects of empirical research for testing the empirical validity of these propositions.</p>
            <p>This note concerns the creative potential of tropes in the process of analogical reasoning. We first suggest that metaphors (including metonymy and synecdoche) operate within the "cognitive comfort zone" of similarity. Thus, analogically, they are best seen as a means of elaborating and explicating existing knowledge. Second, we make the case for greater analytical attention to be paid to the so-called lesser tropes of anomaly, paradox, and irony, which are based on dissimilarity. These operate within the "cognitive discomfort zone," open up genuine alternative possibilities, and, analogically, provide a more fruitful source of knowledge generation.</p>

            <p>A growing number of sociologists, political scientists, economists, and organizational theorists have invoked the concept of social capital in the search for answers to a broadening range of questions being confronted in their own fields. Seeking to clarify the concept and help assess its utility for organizational theory, we synthesize the theoretical research undertaken in these various disciplines and develop a common conceptual framework that identifies the sources, benefits, risks, and contingencies of social capital.</p>
            <p>Although traditional behavioral decision theory as applied to negotiation sheds light on some of the barriers encountered in negotiations, it does not fully account for many of the difficulties and failures to reach settlement in ideologically based disputes. In this article we identify a number of factors that differentiate ideologically based negotiations from other types of negotiations and advance a perspective that takes into account the value-laden and institutional contexts in which they occur. We illustrate our ideas by applying them to the organizationally relevant example of environmental disputes.</p>
            <p>I consider the interactive effects of procedural fairness and outcome favorability on people's reactions to organizational decisions. When the dependent variable consists of employees' support for decisions, for decision makers, or for organizations, outcome favorability has less influence when procedural fairness is high rather than low. When the dependent variable consists of employees' self-evaluations, however, outcome favorability has more influence when procedural fairness is high rather than low. Explanations, implications, and future research directions are discussed.</p>
            <p>Claims that religion can influence ethical behavior in business are plausible to many people but problematic in light of existing research. Our analysis indicates that religious role expectations, internalized as a religious self-identity, can influence ethical behavior. However, relationships of religious role expectations to behavior are moderated by religious identity salience and religious motivational orientation. We conclude by discussing the influence of organizational context on religious identity salience and the need for innovative and interdisciplinary empirical research on religion and ethical behavior in organizations.</p>
            <p>In this article an extension of agency theory based on problems that arise in agency relationships, even when agents are assumed to be honest and dutiful, is put forward. With one exception, these assumptions lead to essentially the same predictions as in standard agency theory, suggesting that effects commonly attributed to self-seeking may be better understood as more fundamental effects of the agency relationship itself. This analysis raises a number of previously unexplored research questions concerning the nature of managerial agency relationships.</p>
            <p>The goal of this article is to help managers, students, and scholars contend with moral business problems by urging efforts to develop an adequate "managerial moral strategy." Integrative social contract theory (ISCT) is arguably the most promising candidate available, but a critical analysis reveals a shortcoming: it lacks sufficient moral content. Alleviating this weakness requires the formulation of the moral principles applicable to management. Doing so will elevate the usefulness and the influence of ISCT and the business ethics enterprise generally.</p>
            <p>There are problems of fit between standard research practices in the domain of turnover research and evolutionary decisional processes like job search. I analyze this problem from methodological, empirical, and conceptual vantage points. Reanalysis of data suggests that the ability to accurately estimate employment opportunity is related to one's temporal positioning within the turnover process. Using cybernetic decision theory as a point of departure, I propose a model conceptualizing employment search processes as a series of decision stages.</p>

            <p>We present a model linking perceptions of job insecurity to emotional reactions and negative coping behaviors. Our model is based on the idea that emotional variables explain, in part discrepant findings reported in previous research. In particular, we propose that emotional intelligence moderates employees' emotional reactions to job insecurity and their ability to cope with associated stress. In this respect, low emotional intelligence employees are more likely than high emotional intelligence employees to experience negative emotional reactions to job insecurity and to adopt negative coping strategies.</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical model of international assignments in which we examine the alignment or nonalignment of the organization's and the individual's expectations of an assignment and its effect on assignment success. We consider four basic configurations in our model-mutual loyalty, mutual transaction, agent opportunism, and principal opportunism-and present a matrix of organization-individual alignment to help predict varying degrees of success in expatriate assignment and in repatriation. Finally, we apply this matrix as a framework for understanding changes in the employment contract over time.</p>
            <p>Virtual customer communities enable firms to establish distributed innovation models that involve varied customer roles in new product development. In this article I use a multitheoretic lens to examine the design of such virtual customer environments, focusing on four underlying theoretical themes (interaction pattern, knowledge creation, customer motivation, and virtual customer community-new product development team integration) and deriving their implications for virtual customer environment design. I offer propositions that relate specific virtual customer environment design elements to successful customer value creation, and thereby to new product development success.</p>

            <p>In this article we argue that (1) legitimacy is an important resource for gaining other resources, (2) such resources are crucial for new venture growth, and (3) legitimacy can be enhanced by the strategic actions of new ventures. We review the impact of legitimacy on new ventures as well as sources of legitimacy for new ventures, present strategies for new ventures to acquire legitimacy, explore the process of building legitimacy in the new venture, and examine the concept of the legitimacy threshold.</p>
            <p>We present a model of employee decision making and behavior in which employees may sometimes decide to pursue learning and development activities, depending on personal values, leader-member exchange, perceived organizational support, self-efficacy for development, and credibility of information source. Within a three-dimensional "perceived beneficiary" system, employees may perceive these activities to benefit not only themselves but also (or alternatively) a supervisor and/or the organization. We show connections involving prosocial organizational behavior and organizational citizenship behavior and offer five propositions.</p>
            <p>We develop a social exchange perspective of alliance constellations, emphasizing the role of generalized exchanges. We then discuss three social control mechanisms for mitigating the unique difficulties of managing constellations, and we conclude by proposing a typology of constellations based on the dimensions of exchange horizon and type of generalized reciprocity. The perspective presented here contributes not only to research on alliances but also to the larger body of literature on generalized social exchange processes, which has traditionally been centered on interpersonal relations.</p>
            <p>Previous research on organizational citizenship behavior indicates that such behavior is critical for organizational effectiveness, but little theoretical work details how it might contribute to enhanced organizational functioning. Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) argue that a firm's social capital comprises a critical source of sustainable organizational advantage. Based on their work, we suggest that citizenship behaviors enhance firm functioning by contributing to the development of social capital in organizations; specifically, citizenship behaviors contribute to the creation of structural, relational, and cognitive forms of social capital.</p>

            <p>This article provides a critique of current work on the "greening" of organizations, especially work based on "ecocentric" argument. I question the meaning of "nature" and use studies of the sociology of order and networks to debate the assumptions of current "green" discourse and its normative rationales. I advance an interdependency network perspective, applying it to the greening of organizations, green technologies, and issues of globalization, and I argue that this perspective offers an alternative theoretical rationale and a potential basis for future research.</p>

            <p>In this article we introduce the concept of cultural recomposition and propose its effects on group interaction processes. To gain an understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these effects, we employ self-categorization theory and control chart theory. From these we develop our own theory, proposing that cultural recomposition causes the type of variation in group interaction processes that may have substantial implications for group performance. We also identify factors that may determine whether cultural recomposition will cause this type of variation in group interaction processes.</p>

            <p>The fledgling literature concerning institutional investors' impact on U.S. corporations has been plagued by mixed results. We argue that an improved understanding of an intervening variable-investor activism-may help to clarify future studies. In this article we synthesize the financial, legal, and management literature to arrive at an integrated model of twelve key variables that may lead to variations in these investors levels of activism and, hence, their impact on firm behavior.</p>
            <p>In this article we expand on Albert's (1995) early attempts to apply music theory to the analysis of point-timing questions-questions of when to act. Building upon the Albert P<sup>5</sup>model by applying concepts such as tonality, rhythm, musical shape, and harmony, we seek to understand why the FBI launched its assault upon David Koresh's compound in Waco, Texas, when it did. We suggest alternative solutions that might have resolved the crisis without the loss of life and consider the contribution of music theory to the problem of timing in general.</p>
            <p>We propose a model in which between-individual differences in performance (heterogeneity) and within-individual differences in performance over time (variability) affect flow line performance. The impact of heterogeneity and variability is contingent upon the flow line context, particularly the rules governing the way work moves between employees (work flow policy). We show how subtle changes in this policy can have a motivational effect on heterogeneity and variability and how these, in turn, can impact the relationship between work flow policy and flow line performance.</p>

            <p>We draw from the recently developed construct of institutional distance to propose a framework that explains foreign direct investment by the multinational enterprise. We decompose the institutional distance between the host and home countries into distances on the regulative, normative, and cognitive dimensions of institutions, and match these with firm-level attributes to produce propositions regarding host country selection and foreign market entry strategies.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this study is to extend the literature on grounded theory development to incorporate considerations for team-based, interdisciplinary longitudinal research projects in the domain of organizational studies. Every element of the research process is affected if the research questions call for team-based data collection and interpretation over a lengthy period of time. It is unusual for a team of scholars from different disciplines to work together, not because the need doesn't exist, but because the mechanisms for doing so are not well established. We draw from the writings of scholars in the fields of research methodology, team and work-group design, and project management to inform our thinking on the subject. The work presented here is based on the authors' experiences during 1995-1999 as members of the Radical Innovation Research Program (RIRP). The RIRP is an ongoing multidisciplinary study of the development and management of radical innovations in established firms. Here, we do not describe the findings or insights associated with the content of the study, radical innovation, which is surely a complex managerial phenomenon. Rather, we focus on the processes used to conduct the research that were affected by the need for a multidisciplinary research team. A framework is presented for thinking about managing such a project. Challenges that we encountered within this framework are identified. Mechanisms we used (or, in some cases, wish we had used in retrospect) for confronting those challenges are also described. Throughout, we compare our study objectives and resultant methodological design choices with those of other multidisciplinary research teams that are by now well known in the organizational management literature. Our objective is to help researchers who are considering launching interdisciplinary, longitudinal studies of organizational processes as they plan and manage those pursuits.</p>
            <p>This study investigates whether the performance of organizational citizenship behavior and three indicators of social status-hierarchical position, gender, and race-predict employees' vulnerability to being victimized by the harmful actions of others. We hypothesize that interpersonally directed organizational citizenship deflects mistreatment by others because it enhances social attractiveness and creates bonds of mutual obligation and reciprocity. However, drawing from prior research that shows that people with high social status are perceived more favorably than people with low status, we also hypothesize that benefits of organizational citizenship are more likely to accrue to employees in high, as compared to low, status groups. Data were from 448 employees of a U.S. manufacturing firm. As expected, citizenship was more strongly and negatively related to perceived victimization for whites as compared to African-Americans. However, contrary to our prediction, citizenship was more strongly related to perceived victimization among employees with low, as compared to high, hierarchical status. No moderating effect of gender was found. Implications for organizations are discussed and future research directions are offered.</p>
            <p>This study examines whether employment extemalization, or the use of temporary and contract workers in organizations, is associated with weak psychological bonds between the internal workforce and organization. Specifically, the extent and length of such extemalization would negatively relate to internal workers' trust in, commitment toward, and psychological contract with organizations. The premise for this argument is that internal workers may view extemalization as an indicator of the organization's low-level commitment to them. Internal workers would reciprocate by decreasing their attachment to the organization. Extemalization might also be seen as violating the psychological contract between employees and employers, since extemalization is associated with slowed upward mobility and poor work support for internal workers. However, organizational actions that indicate commitment toward employees would mitigate such negative effects. I posit that extemalization would be viewed less negatively both by workers who believe they have secure jobs, and by those who supervise and train others. These hypotheses were tested with data collected from 256 internal workers in three organizations. Results indicate that both the extent and length of externalization are negatively related to internal workers' attitudes, especially for those of internal workers with fewer supervisory responsibilities. However, contrary to the hypotheses, the relationship is also more negative for internal workers with high job security.</p>
            <p>Multimarket (or multipoint) contact has been shown to deter aggressive actions by rivals toward each other, producing a situation of mutual forbearance among firms. To create this deterrent capability, however, firms must enter each others' markets, which is just the kind of action that the deterrent is supposed to limit. This study explores the questions: Under what conditions are firms likely to behave aggressively toward their multimarket rivals by entering their markets and when will they engage in mutual forbearance? We describe how the effect of multimarket contact on the market-entry moves of a firm changes as the level of contact a firm has with its rivals increases. We draw on competitive intelligence and decision-making theory to argue that the competitive advantages associated with multimarket contact are supplemented by the fact that a firm's multimarket competitors serve as a readily available model to reduce the uncertainty associated with market-entry decisions. We hypothesize that these factors lead firms to prefer, up to the point where forbearance concerns become paramount, to enter the markets in which their multipoint rivals already compete. We also argue that once multimarket contact levels reach the point where forbearance begins to operate, these levels also serve to stabilize the structure through better competitive intelligence, with the result that the propensity of a firm to enter into additional markets of its multimarket rivals declines. We then extend multimarket theory by focusing on the role of the CEO. Specifically, we argue that newer and longer-tenured CEOs are likely to face different influences on their preferences for particular competitive actions. We test hypotheses that link the likelihood that CEOs will abide by the mutual interdependencies that their firm's multimarket ties represent to their tenure in the CEO position. Our findings produce support for an inverted-U-shaped relationship between multipoint contact and market entry. We also find evidence that longer-tenured CEOs are guided by their firm's multimarket relationships. Newer CEOs, however, do not seem to adopt a forbearance approach toward their firm's multimarket competitors. Our findings have important implications for multimarket theory. This study is among the first to examine the role of managers within a multimarket context. We show that it is not enough for a firm to be embedded within a multimarket structure, but that for a firm to benefit from its multimarket position, its managers must be aware of this positioning and free of other influences that could cause them to behave in ways that are inconsistent with it. Because our findings show that newer CEOs can direct their firms to act in ways that are inconsistent with their firm's multimarket position, we identify an area of potential competitive vulnerability for the firm.</p>
            <p>We present a view of trust in boundary spanners as explained by the extent of role autonomy, a multidimensional concept that reflects the discretion that agents have in interpreting and enacting their roles. We argue that, in a buyer-supplier context, purchasing managers will be trusted to a greater extent by supplier representatives when they are free from constraints that limit their ability to interpret their boundary-spanning roles. We conceptualize and measure three key components of role autonomy: Functional influence, tenure, and clan culture. Taken together, these components of role autonomy shape and define the purchasing manager's willingness and capacity to make and uphold commitments to supplier representatives. Role autonomy permits purchasing managers to engage in discretionary behaviors that allow supplier representatives to learn about their underlying motives and intentions. We test hypotheses linking the components of role autonomy to trust on a sample of 119 buyer-supplier relationships. We use a dyadic research design that combines data from purchasing managers and supplier representatives. The results suggest that granting purchasing managers greater autonomy enhances supplier representative trust in purchasing managers. By drawing attention to role autonomy as a feature of organizations that influences trust we highlight the importance of organizational context in contributing to a deeper understanding of trust.</p>
            <p>To understand what determines knowledge flows into organizational subunits, the study reported here examines the relevance of the knowledge to the operations performed at the receiving subunit. This study analyzes inflows of knowledge from peers and supervising units into subunits of multinational corporations. It examines factors that affect the relevance of extra-unit knowledge to receiving subunits and explores empirically how these factors affect knowledge flows. The results show that knowledge travels along established ties from large knowledge bases into unspecialized, codified, locally responsive knowledge bases. The results are consistent with the view that relevance provides pathways through which new knowledge connects to prior knowledge.</p>
            <p>The bulk of our understanding of teams is based on traditional teams in which all members are collocated and communicate face to face. However, geographically distributed teams, whose members are not collocated and must often communicate via technology, are growing in prevalence. Studies from the field are beginning to suggest that geographically distributed teams operate differently and experience different outcomes than traditional teams. For example, empirical studies suggest that distributed teams experience high levels of conflict. These empirical studies offer rich and valuable descriptions of this conflict, but they do not systematically identify the mechanisms by which conflict is engendered in distributed teams. In this paper, we develop a theory-based explanation of how geographical distribution provokes team-level conflict. We do so by considering the two characteristics that distinguish distributed teams from traditional ones: Namely, we examine how being distant from one's team members and relying on technology to mediate communication and collaborative work impacts team members. Our analysis identifies antecedents to conflict that are unique to distributed teams. We predict that conflict of all types (task, affective, and process) will be detrimental to the performance of distributed teams, a result that is contrary to much research on traditional teams. We also investigate conflict as a dynamic process to determine how teams might mitigate these negative impacts over time.</p>
            <p>We propose a new model of knowledge creation in purposeful, loosely coordinated, distributed systems, as an alternative to a firm-based one. Specifically, using the case of the Linux kernel development project, we build a model of community-based, evolutionary knowledge creation to study how thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the Internet to produce a knowledge-intensive, innovative product of high quality. By comparing and contrasting the Linux model with the traditional/commercial model of software development and firm-based knowledge creation efforts, we show how the proposed model of knowledge creation expands beyond the boundary of the firm. Our model suggests that the product development process can be effectively organized as an evolutionary process of learning driven by criticism and error correction. We conclude by offering some theoretical implications of our community-based model of knowledge creation for the literature of organizational learning, community life, and the uses of knowledge in society.</p>
            <p>To create a competitive advantage, firms need to find activity configurations that are not only internally consistent, but also appropriate given the firm's current environment. This challenge is particularly acute after firms have experienced an environmental change that has shifted the existing competitive landscape and created new, high-performing sets of activity choices. How should firms organize to explore and search such an altered performance landscape? While it has been noted that adaptive entities need to maintain a balance of exploration and exploitation, little is known about how different organizational structures moderate this balance. With the help of an agent-based simulation model, we study the value of three different organizational structures: a centralized organization, in which decisions are made only at the level of the firm as a whole; a decentralized organization, in which decisions are made independently in two divisions; and a temporarily decentralized firm, which starts out with a decentralized structure and later reintegrates. We find that if interactions among a firm's activities are pervasive, neither the centralized nor the permanently decentralized organizational structure leads to high performance. In this case, temporary decentralization-an organizational structure that has not found much attention in the literature-yields the highest long-term performance. This organizational structure allows the firm both to avoid low-performing activity configurations and to eventually coordinate across its divisions. Thus, even if the decision problem a firm faces is not fully decomposable, a temporary bifurcation can lead to a higher long-term performance outcome. Initial decentralized exploration is, however, costly in the short run, as compared to centralized exploration. As a result, a tradeoff exists between the short-term costs of decentralized exploration and the long-term benefits of reaching higher performance. As interactions across and within divisions increase, the optimal length of decentralized exploration tends to grow. Paralleling our first result, we further show that even if a decision problem is decomposable, that is, can be perfectly modularized, it can be beneficial to create a temporary decision allocation that creates "unnecessary" interdependencies across the subsystems. This benefit arises in particular when the modules are complex by themselves. In both cases, an initial phase of exploration, enabled by an appropriate organizational structure, followed by refinement and coordination, enabled by a different structure, leads to high performance. To illustrate our general model, we focus on incumbent firms' responses to the Internet and discuss implications for the product design process.</p>
            <p>A growing body of literature suggests that populations of organizations are not homogeneous, but instead comprise distinct subentities. Firms are highly dependent on their immediate institutional and competitive environments. The present paper further explores this issue by focusing on the spatial and temporal sources of industry heterogeneity. Our goal is three-fold. First, we explore founding rates as a function of spatial density, arguing that density-dependent processes occur along a geographic gradient ranging from proximate, to neighboring, to more distant contexts. Second, we show how multiple, local evolutionary clocks shape such entrepreneurial activity. Third, we provide evidence on how diffusion processes are directly affected by social contagion, with new organizational forms spreading through movements of individuals. Results from data on the Dutch accounting industry corroborate these patterns of heterogeneity.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the link between organizational culture and effectiveness for foreign-owned firms operating in Russia. Beginning with a model of organizational culture developed in the United States, the paper presents a multimethod analysis of culture and effectiveness in a transition economy. We argue that effectiveness in Russia relies more on adaptability and flexibility than it does in the United States. Furthermore, the legacy of the Communist era forces firms in Russia to deal with a workforce with a unique time perspective and a unique set of subcultures that often undermine attempts at coordination and integration. We first explore these ideas using survey data on 179 foreign-owned firms operating in Russia and compare the results to those obtained for firms in the United States. We then present four case studies designed to ground the results in the Russian context, and to document cultural dynamics not captured by the model.</p>
            <p>This paper develops and tests a model of multilevel experience-based top management team competence and its effects on a firm's capacity of entrepreneurial growth. The model incorporates the individual and additive effects of firm, team, and industry levels of managerial experience and the conflict effects of combining multiple levels of experience. Theoretical arguments are tested in a longitudinal sample of entrepreneurial firms from the medical and surgical instruments industry. The results indicate that founders' participation in the top management team and managers' past experience in the industry contribute to the competence of the team in seizing new growth opportunities. The results also show that, because of conflict effects, the positive effect of founders' participation in the management team on the rate of growth weakens as either the shared team-specific experience or industry-specific managerial experience in the team increases. For practitioners, the most important implication is that for sustained growth, entrepreneurial firms should learn to balance different levels of managerial experience in the top management team. One way to achieve this balance is to retain valuable founder resources in the team while avoiding high levels of shared team-specific experience and industry-specific managerial experience.</p>
            <p>Adopted by an increasing number of organizations around the world, the ISO 9000 standards have become a growing concern for more and more managers who are often compelled to adopt this system without really knowing its requirements and implications for employees. Though the effects of this standard on quality management and on performance improvement have been widely debated, there is little knowledge of how the managers and employees who are asked to implement and maintain it perceive the ISO 9000 standards or resist its use. This study will thus attempt to analyze this perception and resistance with regard to both the standard and the certification process. So as to avoid the traditional and idealised view of this standard, whose commercial stakes often give rise to uncritical statements, almost 50 interviews were conducted outside of the workplace. The results of these interviews revealed highly contrasting attitudes that were frequently critical of the ISO 9000 system, which was often given only superficial support. A qualitative analysis of the data allowed us to identify three types of respondents. They were grouped according to their opinions and attitudes about the implementation of this standard. The three groups were ceremonial integrators, quality enthusiasts and dissidents. Although the "quality enthusiasts" discourse often reflects managers' "rhetoric of success" described by Zbaracki (1998) about the implementation of total quality programs, this rhetoric is not shared by the other respondent categories. Hence, this research project contributes to a better understanding of how institutional pressures, which create "isomorphic" organizations by leading them to adopt identical management models, are reinterpreted, renegotiated, and modified within organizations. The proposed typology casts doubt on the mechanistic, consensual, and monolithic view of the ISO 9000 system that underlies most of the work on this theme. In particular, this study demonstrates the relevance of adopting both the institutionalist and critical approaches in efforts to explain the respondents' opinions. In so doing, the personnel's support for the ISO 9000 system and the certification process can then be analyzed from different angles. This certification process would ultimately appear to be a rite of passage that gives rise to various strategies that depend on the respondents' category and their support for the standard.</p>
            <p>We argue that employees' organizational justice perceptions are, in part, influenced by whom they associate with in the workplace. Consequently, we examine the link between different types of social ties and the interpersonal similarity of employees' perceptions of interactional, procedural, and distributive justice through a social network study in a division of a Fortune 500 firm. We predicted and found that social ties influence perceptions of justice to different extents, depending on the type of justice assessed. Expressive ties were associated with greater similarity in coworkers' perceptions than instrumental ties in the most affect-inducing justice perceptions, perceptions of interactional justice. Our findings suggest that the opinions held by an individual's coworkers influence others' justice perceptions, especially when justice is ambiguous and affect inducing, and that different justice perceptions may be transmitted via different types of social ties.</p>
            <p>Organizations learn from other organizations. However, the observations available to them are typically a biased sample. The organizations that can be observed at any point in time are the survivors of a selective process that has eliminated a large fraction of the underlying population. In addition, there is a strong tendency to focus on successful organizations in books and the business press. As a result, the available sample of organizations usually undersamples failure. This paper shows that such undersampling of failure can contribute to a variety of false beliefs about effective management. Simply by observing existing organizations, laymen may get a misleading picture of the determinants of corporate performance. In particular, risky practices, even if they are unrelated to performance in the full population of organizations, may seem to be positively related to performance in a sample of survivors. I argue that this bias frequently implies that the organizational theories of managers and other observers of organizations will be systematically biased. Observations of existing organizations will show that unreliable, uninformed practices and practices that involve concentrated resource allocation are superior to reliable, informed practices or practices that involve diversified resource allocation. I show that this implies that observations of existing organizations will produce compelling but potentially misleading evidence for the significance several common managerial practices.</p>
            <p>The initial public offering (IPO) is one of the most critical events in the lifetime of a young firm. Prior research has shown that firms tend to have successful IPOs if they go public with the endorsement of a prestigious lead underwriter. This paper examines the antecedents to receiving endorsement by a prestigious underwriter and links this to the experience base of a firm's upper echelon. We theorize that the amount and type of upper echelon experience serve as important symbols of a young firm's legitimacy to critical outsiders. We introduce a typology of upper echelon experience that distinguishes between upper echelon upstream, horizontal, and downstream employment-based affiliations and suggest that these different types of upper echelon affiliations allay different types of endorser concerns regarding firm legitimacy, affecting the endorsement process. Further, we theorize that the relationships between upper echelon experience and investment bank prestige will be moderated by technological uncertainty. We test our assertions on a comprehensive sample of public and private biotechnology firms that were founded between 1961 and 1994 and that went public between 1979 and 1996. Analyses of the five-year career histories of the over 3,200 executives and directors that make up the upper echelons of these firms show that firms with upper echelons with affiliations with prominent downstream organizations (i.e., pharmaceutical and/or healthcare companies) and with prominent horizontal organizations (i.e., biotechnology companies) are more likely to attract the endorsement of a prestigious investment bank. We also find that the greater the range of upper echelon affiliations across the categories of upstream, horizontal, and downstream affiliations, the more prestigious the firm's lead underwriter. We also find that these latter results are moderated by technological uncertainty. The present research has implications for the study of organizational legitimacy, interorganizational endorsements, and entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p>We examine how experiential learning affects organizational change and its consequences on firm mortality. We develop hypotheses about the interactions of experiences with a specific type of organizational change on the one hand, and environmental stability, organizational size, and organizational niche width on the other hand. Our findings draw from analysis of the U.S. automobile industry between 1885 and 1981 and support the general prediction that "process" effects of change in the organizational core elevate the hazard of failure. We also find that a dynamic interpretation of organizational environments as comprised of other organizations helps to explicate the interplay between organization and environmental forces that shape the occurrence and outcome of transformation.</p>
            <p>This paper critically addresses the coherence, reception, and dissemination of "situated learning theory" (Lave and Wenger 1991). Situated learning theory commends a conceptualization of the process of learning that, in offering an alternative to cognitive theories, departs radically from the received body of knowledge on learning in organizations. The paper shows how elements of situated learning theory have been selectively adopted to fertilize or extend the established terrain of organizational learning. In this process, we argue, Lave and Wenger's embryonic appreciation of power relations as media of learning is displaced by a managerial preoccupation with harnessing (reified) "communities of practice" to the fulfillment of (reified) corporate objectives. We illustrate our argument by reference to Orr's (1990, 1996) study of photocopier technicians, which is very widely cited as an example of the "new," situated conceptualization of learning in communities of practice. We commend a revitalization of situated learning theory in which learning practices are understood to be enabled and constrained by their embeddedness in relations of power; and, more specifically, by the unstable institutionalization of power relations within capitalist work organizations.</p>
            <p>This paper examines the impact of knowledge tacitness on a firm's propensity to establish plants in foreign rather than domestic locations. Our predictions build on knowledge-based, internalization, and evolutionary theories of foreign direct investment. We argue that the tacitness of technology has an inverted-U effect on the propensity to undertake foreign investment. We also expect that as a firm learns about a technology, it will become more likely to make foreign investments. We examine two forms of learning: that which accumulates as a function of the number of plants previously built by the firm (transfer-based learning), and that which accumulates as a function of time since the firm started using a technology (time-based learning). We investigate empirical effects in a sample of investments in the memory segment of the semiconductor industry. Our predictions about the curvilinear effect of tacitness are supported. The results also suggest that learning is a matter of taking time to become acquainted with the use of the technology, and of gaining experience through successive foreign plant investments. The study adds to the understanding of the effects of knowledge on corporate expansion.</p>
            <p>This paper suggests that knowledge is shared in organizations through the transformation of occupational communities' situated understandings of their work. In this paper, I link the misunderstandings between engineers, technicians, and assemblers on a production floor to their work contexts, and demonstrate how members of these communities overcome such problems by cocreating common ground that transforms their understanding of the product and the production process. In particular, I find that the communities' knowledge-sharing difficulties are rooted in differences in their language, the locus of their practice, and their conceptualization of the product. When communication problems arise, if members of these communities provide solutions which invoke the differences in the work contexts and create common ground between the communities, they can transform the understandings of others and generate a richer understanding of the product and the problems they face.</p>
            <p>Infusing hierarchies with elements of market control has become a much-used way of simultaneously increasing entrepreneurialism and motivation in firms. However, this paper argues that such "internal hybrids," particularly in their radical forms, are inherently hard to successfully design and implement because of a fundamental incentive problem of establishing credible managerial commitments to not intervene in delegated decision making. This theme is developed and illustrated, using the case of the world-leading hearing aids producer, Oticon. In the beginning of the 1990s, Oticon became famous for its radical internal hybrid, the "spaghetti organization." Recent work has interpreted the spaghetti organization as a radical attempt to foster dynamic capabilities by organizational means, neglecting, however, that about a decade later the spaghetti organization has given way to a more traditional matrix organization. In contrast, an organizational economics interpretation of Oticon organizational changes is developed. This lens suggests that a strong liability of the spaghetti organization was the above incentive problem: Frequent managerial meddling with delegated rights led to a severe loss of motivation, and arguably caused the change to a more structured organization. Refutable implications are developed, and the discussion is broadened to more general issues of economic organization.</p>
            <p>This article develops a formal theory of the structural aspects of organizational change. It concentrates on changes in an organization's architecture, depicted as a code system. It models the common process whereby an initial architectural change prompts other changes in the organization, generating a cascade of changes that represents the full reorganization. The main argument ties centrality of the organizational unit initiating a change to the total time that the organization spends reorganizing and to the associated opportunity costs. The central theorem holds that the expected deleterious effect of a change in architecture on the mortality hazard increases with viscosity and the intricacy of the organizational design.</p>
            <p>This study examines the relationship between racial composition and individual, voluntary turnover for minorities (i.e., Asians, blacks, and Hispanics) in a large organization. We present a critical test for two sets of contrasting predictions. The first draws on similarity attraction, social contact, and social identity theories to suggest that working with racially similar others enhances the work environment in terms of perceived career opportunities, mentoring relationships, and network ties, all of which would increase the likelihood of remaining in an organization. The contrasting predictions draw on group competition and group threat theories and propose that working with racially similar others might increase competition for resources and generate a backlash effect against minorities that would induce their turnover. We suggest the paradox that these two approaches might be compatible if the effect of demographic composition is nonlinear. Our data analyses show that individuals' likelihood of turnover decreases as the proportion of employees in a job from one's own race increases. Furthermore, this relationship is nonlinear: Members of minority groups with very small representation benefited more from the increased presence of their own race than minorities who already had a substantial presence. This finding suggests a potential backlash effect at higher minority proportions. Results also show that turnover decreases as the proportion of employees from one's own race increases in the level above an employee's job. Overall, these findings suggest that working with others of the same race reduces the likelihood of minority exits. Interestingly, the proportion of other minorities in a job has a marginally significant, negative effect on employees' voluntary turnover. Thus, increasing racial diversity from one's own race and other minorities appears to strengthen minority workforce retention.</p>
            <p>Systematic differences in the determinants of firm failure between firms that fail early in their life and those that fail after having successfully negotiated the early liabilities of newness and adolescence are identified. Analysis of data from 339 Canadian corporate bankruptcies suggests that failure among younger firms may be attributable to deficiencies in managerial knowledge and financial management abilities. Failure among older firms, on the other hand, may be attributable to an inability to adapt to environmental change.</p>
            <p>In this research, we traced the development of natural environmental issues in two organizations in real time over the period of a year. Participant observations, discussions with organizational members, and corporate documents yielded insights used to develop a model describing issue flows in both organizations. With this model, we identified the factors that influenced the scope, scale, and speed of organizational response to issues. Our methods provided insights into why issues generated organizational responses and also why they did not. Two factors appeared to be critical in explaining organizational responses to issues: individual concerns and organizational values. Individual concerns gave rise to an issue champion or seller. An issue consistent with organizational values was perceived as strategic. These were necessary conditions; without either condition, the issue would not be resolved. It is argued further that individual discretion and excess resource slack will moderate the relationship between these direct effects and the scope, scale, and speed of organizational response. The framework that emerged from the data is conveyed through a set of four propositions.</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the concept of sequential variety as a way to measure variability in the sequence of steps used to perform a work process. There is reason to expect that such variability may influence a range of outcomes, such as flexibility and quality. Two alternative ways to operationalize sequential variety are demonstrated and compared to traditional measures of task variety in four task units. The findings provide empirical support for treating sequential variety as a distinct construct. In particular, sequential variety appears to provide an index of tacit, procedural knowledge, while task variety may relate more closely to explicit, declarative knowledge.</p>
            <p>We present a mathematical model that predicts and explains the circumstances under which a management-defined communication structure can add value to an organization. This model provides a game-theoretical basis for contingent organizational design by relating empirical observations of real organizations to the solution of a rational choice model based on game theory. We constructed a multiple-player, noncooperative game in which players have full knowledge of, and universal communication access to, each other. These players allocate the scarce resource of their attention among potential interaction partners. It struck us that this game sometimes did and sometimes did not have a "core," i.e., a confluence of individual optima (Nash equilibrium) that was also optimal for the whole group. Some circumstances allow the best structure to emerge from many individual decisions, whereas other circumstances require the imposition of structured communication channels by a central decision maker. Strong management control of communication structure adds no value in business environments where the game has a core-i.e., where a centrally imposed optimum would dictate the same communications patterns as those defined by the Nash equilibrium that emerges spontaneously when each participant optimizes locally. Trade in an ideal market is the iconic example of such environments. In our model, other combinations of conditions fail to yield a core, even though a single stable Nash equilibrium always exists. The difference between aggregate effectiveness at the Nash equilibrium and the maximal feasible aggregate effectiveness that could be centrally dictated is the value that management can provide through enforcing the globally optimum communication regime. The predictions of this simple model about the conditions that favor more- or less-structured communications agree surprisingly well with accepted organizational contingency theory. Our simple model thus provides a sound theoretical foundation for many aspects of contingent organizational design.</p>
            <p>Mainstream organizational research is based on science and the humanities. Science helps us to understand organized systems, from an outsider position, as empirical objects. The humanities contribute to understanding, and critically reflecting on, the human experience of actors inside organized practices. This paper argues that, in view of the persistent relevance gap between theory and practice, organization studies should be broadened to include design as one of its primary modes of engaging in research. Design is characterized by its emphasis on solution finding, guided by broader purposes and ideal target systems. Moreover, design develops, and draws on, design propositions that are tested in pragmatic experiments and grounded in organization science. This study first explores the main differences and synergies between science and design, and explores how and why the design discipline has largely moved away from academia to other sites in the economy. The argument then turns to the genealogy of design methodologies in organization and management studies. Subsequently, this paper explores the circular design methodology that serves to illustrate the nature of design research, that is, the pragmatic focus on actionable knowledge as well as the key role of ideal target systems in design processes. Finally, the author proposes a framework for communication and collaboration between the science and design modes, and argues that scholars in organization studies can guide human beings in the process of designing and developing their organizations toward more humane, participative, and productive futures. In this respect, the organization discipline can make a difference.</p>
            <p>In this paper we investigate a uniquely complex organizational context-that of the fast-tracked large-scale project management of a significant piece of Sydney 2000 Olympic infrastructure, which we researched in terms of its management through the "future perfect." In a grounded analysis we resolved to track how the future perfect developed in the life of one large, complex project whose uniqueness meant that it was unable to be strategically planned in advance. We tracked the use of what we term "future perfect strategy" through analysis of data collected both in leadership meetings of the directing agency, "PALT"-Project Alliance Leadership Team-as well as in individual interviews that we conducted in and around the project, and through analysis of media coverage. Overall, the project was a success, but some problems arose along the way to completion. Largely, these were focused on issues of social rather than technical construction-something even the most strategic of plans cannot account for. As well as identifying some of the specific mechanisms for encouraging future perfect strategy that were used in the project, including encouraging "strange conversations," "playing end games," "workshopping," and "projecting feelings, concerns and issues," we also suggest some ways that the social construction issues might be handled in the future.</p>
            <p>While previous literature tends to focus on role models as significant other people, particularly in one's early life, this study finds that individuals tend to construe their role models as a selection process of attributes from others throughout their career. I discovered that individuals primarily construe their role models along positive/negative, global/specific, close/distant, and hierarchically superior/peer-subordinate dimensions, and that across the career span, the tendency to observe role models did not change. Rather, the emphasis placed on different dimensions of role models changes. Early-stage respondents who are working on creating a viable self-concept were more likely to construe their role models as positive, close, and sources of a range of attributes. Middle- and late-stage respondents were more likely to see their role models as sources of specific, and often negative, attributes. The study suggests that these observed patterns are related to individuals' increasing confidence in their professional self-concept. In early stages, individuals pay attention to role models to create a viable self-concept; in middle stages, they seek to refine their self-concept, and in late stages, they seek to enhance and affirm their self-concept.</p>
            <p>This study examines the adoption of new products and processes in the Australian retail banking industry over the 1981 to 1995 period. Our analysis demonstrates that the vast majority of observed innovative activity was based on ideas sourced from outside the focal firm, and that innovations diffused very quickly across competing banks. As such, there were no periods during which any bank had proprietary possession of a major product or process innovation. We therefore ask how the banks' innovative activity could affect their relative financial performance positions. We answer this question by developing a set of hypotheses that relate specific features of their histories of innovative activity to their current financial performance. These hypotheses are tested using a detailed data set describing 1,297 modifications made to products and services, distribution technologies, and back-office processes within a sample of Australian retail banks over the sample period. Our results provide support for the general position that establishing an attractive competitive position depends on the specific history of a firm's innovative activity. Banks that undertook more innovative activity, that were more consistent in that activity, and whose composition of activity was somewhat differentiated from the industry norm tended to display superior financial performance. Rather than looking solely for internally generated, inimitable innovations to deliver competitive advantage, these results suggest that active and consistent innovative activity that is somewhat differentiated from competitors can also deliver superior financial performance.</p>
            <p>This study examined the formation and persistence of homophilous, or same-race, friendship ties among racial minorities and whites in a "newcomer" setting. Homophilous ties provide valuable sources of mutual support but may limit racial minorities' access to resources and information in organizations. Study participants were first-year MBA students who entered a program at the same time. We measured network ties at two times: six weeks after the beginning of the students' first semester in the program, and at the beginning of the following semester 3 1/2 months after the second survey. We also administered a separate survey measuring social identity salience prior to the first network survey. Despite the fact that there were fewer same-race ties for racial minorities to choose from, their friendship networks demonstrated greater homophily than those of whites early in the formation of the network and over time. Also, African-Americans were more likely than whites to seek out homophilous friendship ties in other class sections. Race as a salient social identity group membership was positively related to homophily for African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites. Over the time period studied there was no significant change in homophily among the racial groups' networks, despite the explicit promotion of diversity in recruitment of students, formation of heterogeneous classes and teams, and active support by the MBA program administrators. We discuss the practical implications of our findings for organizations that are attempting to increase cultural diversity and promote active interaction among individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.</p>
            <p>In spite of the popularity of institutional explanations of organizational form, most international management research uses dimensions of national culture to explain cross-national differences in individual work centrality. In this study, we show that social institutions explain variance in work centrality in addition to Hofstede's (2001) dimensions of national culture. Using individual-level data from 30,270 interview respondents from the World Value Survey and institutional data for their 26 countries, we developed hypotheses to investigate whether selected social institutions (i.e., socialism, union strength, educational accessibility, social inequality, and industrialization) affect individual work centrality. We tested our cross-level hypotheses using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Findings showed that all of the social institutional variables studied predicted lower work centrality.</p>
            <p>In the last few decades, we have developed a substantial body of knowledge about CEO succession. However, except for some studies of family businesses that lack direct applicability to nonfamily CEO succession, the past studies of succession have not examined the very first succession event in a firm, when the Founder-CEO is replaced, on a large-scale basis. The critical differences between later-stage succession and Founder-CEO succession include the higher level of attachment between Founder-CEOs and the firms they create, the much larger equity holdings of Founder-CEOs (which give them much more control of the firm), the fact that many Founder-CEOs remain in the firm (even though it is being run by their successors), and the fact that nearly all early-stage succession events involve outside successors (in contrast to later-stage succession research, which has focused on the insider-outsider distinction). These differences make it hard to extrapolate from later-stage succession findings to Founder-CEO succession. Therefore, in order to examine Founder-CEO succession, I used field research and grounded theory building to study the factors that should affect Founder-CEO succession in Internet start-ups. I find that there are two central intertemporal events that may affect Founder-CEO succession: The completion of product development and the raising of each round of financing from outside investors. I develop testable hypotheses about how each of these events affect the rate of succession, and then test these hypotheses using an event-history analysis of a unique dataset containing the succession histories of 202 Internet firms. My findings point to multiple "paradoxes of success" in which the Founder-CEO's success at achieving critical milestones actually causes the chance of Founder-CEO succession to rise dramatically.</p>
            <p>Firms often bring in personnel from rivals to gain tacit knowledge and skills. Personnel new to a firm may broaden the firm's knowledge stock, but may not disrupt the firm's ways of organizing. Instead, personnel inflows may contribute to the retention of a firm's traditional ways of organizing. This study tracks the flow of personnel within and across organizational boundaries (intrafirm and interfirm flows) and geographic boundaries (local and cross-border flows) for multiunit banks operating in the Foreign Exchange Trade Industry from 1973-1993. We test how a firm's retention activity responds to inflows of personnel from different sources (e.g., intrafirm, interfirm, local, and cross-border). The findings show that inflows of personnel from different sources increase a firm's retention activity. Rather than adopting changes in behavior in response to an influx of personnel from within or across spatial boundaries, firms in the foreign exchange industry tend to retain their existing ways of organizing. Personnel inflows from a combination of sources, such as local intrafirm, cross-border intrafirm, local interfirm, and cross-border interfirm, also positively affect retention. By examining the differences in the magnitudes of these effects, we empirically show that considering different sources of personnel inflows in combination is worthwhile.</p>
            <p>The resource-based view holds that firms can earn supranormal returns if and only if they have superior resources and those resources are protected by some form of isolating mechanism preventing their diffusion throughout industry. One isolating mechanism that has been proposed for intangible assets is their accumulation process. The hypothesis is that intangible assets are inherently inimitable because would-be imitators need to replicate the entire accumulation path to achieve the same resource position. Thus, entrants can never catch up to incumbents. An interesting challenge to this hypothesis is counterfactual evidence that entrants sometimes outperform incumbents. Such counterfactual evidence should not exist if the theory is strictly correct. This paper attempts to reconcile resource accumulation theory with the counterfactual evidence. We do so by building an intermediate good-production function for a firm's intangible asset stocks. We test the contribution of the intangible asset stock to the firm's final good-production function and examine the extent to which that asset stock deters rival mobility in the pharmaceutical industry. We find that the asset accumulation process itself cannot deter rivals, because asset stocks reach steady state rather quickly. Entrants can achieve an incumbent's intangible asset stock merely by matching its investment until steady state. Thus, we conclude that the accumulation process per se is not an isolating mechanism. While this is perhaps the most important contribution, another contribution is an empirical methodology for characterizing the accumulation function.</p>
            <p>Currently, two models of innovation are prevalent in organization science. The "private investment" model assumes returns to the innovator result from private goods and efficient regimes of intellectual property protection. The "collective action" model assumes that under conditions of market failure, innovators collaborate in order to produce a public good. The phenomenon of open source software development shows that users program to solve their own as well as shared technical problems, and freely reveal their innovations without appropriating private returns from selling the software. In this paper, we propose that open source software development is an exemplar of a compound "private-collective" model of innovation that contains elements of both the private investment and the collective action models and can offer society the "best of both worlds" under many conditions. We describe a new set of research questions this model raises for scholars in organization science. We offer some details regarding the types of data available for open source projects in order to ease access for researchers who are unfamiliar with these, and also offer some advice on conducting empirical studies on open source software development processes.</p>
